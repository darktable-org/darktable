We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 3.8.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-3.8.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-3.8.0).

As always, please don't use the autogenerated tarball provided by
github, but only our tar.xz file. the checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-3.8.0.tar.xz

When updating from the currently stable 3.6.x series, please bear in
mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new
library and configuration will not be usable with 3.6.x any more.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

- Almost 2680 commits to darktable+rawspeed since 3.6
- 954 pull requests handled
- 110 issues closed

## The Big Ones

- New module diffuse and sharpen.

- New scene-referred blurs module.

- Full rework of perspective correction module adding manual correction support.

- Full rework of the shortcuts handling. The new system can handles
  many hardware that are compatible with the MIDI interface. Also the
  shortcuts can handle mouse movements, multiple key press, short or long
  clicks.

- Add support for multiple images in print module. The page can be
  filed with multiple areas which can be moved around an placed into
  the page using a magnetic-grid for precision.

- A new LMMSE demosaic algorithm is introduced which is better suited
  for high ISO and/or noisy images.

- A new guide widget is introduced. This make it possible to display a
  composition grid in any module.

## Other New Features And Changes

- The denoise profile default is now using wavelets mode.

- Add flip buttons in orientation module.

- Remove the background jobs handling in preferences.

- Remove many specific SSE code as the compiler generated code is faster.

- The filename and image id are now displayed by darktable-generate-cache.

- Speed up filename matches in collections module.

- Speed up masks handling.

- Make it possible to auto-apply iop order lib presets.

- The collect folders statuses are properly refresh when a mount is changed.

- An area color picker is selectable by using a <kdb>Right-Click</kdb>

- Add substitutable variables for image dimensions. Adds
  $(SENSOR_HEIGHT) and $(SENSOR_WIDTH) for the absolute pixel
  dimensions of the sensor, implements the existing stubs for
  $(MAX_WIDTH) and $(MAX_HEIGHT) to represent the raw image size,
  and adds $(EXPORT_HEIGHT) and $(EXPORT_WIDTH) for the
  post-cropping final image size.

- Again some work on code speed-up in many different routines ensuring
  better vectorization and/or OpenMP definition. Notably, the
  split-toning, haze removal and soften modules had been improved.

- The beginner preset in module groups is now taking into account the
  workflow (display or scene referred).

- The quick access panel is now taking into account the
  workflow (display or scene referred).

- New sorting options based on capture, import, modification,
  last export and last print times.

- Better colors for waveform and parade scopes.

- Add source module information in raster mask tooltip.

- The following modules have been deprecated:

  - Crop & Rotate : replaced by Crop, Orientation and Rotate and Perspective modules.

    Note that the new Crop module have been moved after Retouch module
    to ensure that the full image can be used a source area.

- Add option to write XMP only when a change is done in the
  darkroom. So there is now three options, never write XMP, always
  write XMP or write XMP only after user has edited the image.

- Improve timezone entry in the geotagging module.

- Add a preference for the number of recent collections to display.

- Add rating support in collect module making possible to create
  presets to select best of 2021 pictures for example.

- Improve default denoise profile smoothing in Y0U0V0 mode.

- Add support for PNG files in watermark module.

- Minor usability improvement in tone equalizer by ensuring the cursor is
  shown on focus and the module is activated on scroll.

- The color picker values are now selectable.

- Improve timeline color scheme.

- Live samples are now displayed in the vector scope.

- Lut3D has been moved after Filmic.

- Add RYB option in vectorscope.

- Better mask auto-tune in tone equalizer.

- Enable tiling in Color Balance RGB, Diffuse and Filmic RGB modules
  to be able to process very large images.

- Improve XMP synchronization window to enable more choices on the way
  to synchronize between the database and XMP.

- Add support for HEIF/HEIC file format.

- Add support for ARM64/Apple M1 as build target.

- The scopes module (previously named histogram) can be moved to the
  left panel.

- Add preference to invert the behavior of mouse scroll up/down on
  masks. At the same time, and for consistency, the scroll-up has been
  set to increase the masks attributes.

- Add timestamp in camera import dialog for consistency with other
  import dialog.

- Show current modules order in the module lib header to save one line
  in GUI.

- Display hue in degree in the split toning module for consistency
  with other modules.

- The rejected images in lighttable are dimmed for them to be better
  distinguishable.

- Remember the last selected Piwigo album in the export module.

- Add vertical waveform in scopes.

- Use a new magic wand icons for automatic actions instead of the
  color picker one. This is used for masks auto-tune in the Tone
  Equalizer module.

- Add HSV reading in color picker.

- For advanced users and developers expose OpenCL building options in
  darktablerc.

- Move the module order entry in the copy/paste dialog at the end for
  better usability as this option is rarely used.

- The collect module offers some new presets based on image time to
  complement the current ones based on the import time.

- Add places section into the import dialog and list there the default
  folders (Home, Document, Images), the mounted drives and other
  folders added by users for quick access.

## Bug Fixes

- Multiple memory leaks have been fixed.

- Fix green equilibration in RCD CPU code path.

- Select the best illuminant for DNG images.

- When trying to enter a view that cannot be used (like the capture if
  there is no camera attached), make sure we reset back to previous
  view the combobox.

- Fix calibration optimizations for delta E in Channel Mixer RGB module.

- Fix focus peaking which was in some cases displaying some wrong
  random pixels on the borders.

- Fix refresh when pasting whole or part of history.

- Fix possible uninitialized-data access in RCD demosaic.

- Update metadata fields when applying a preset.

- Fix creation of liquify interpolated path to be closer to what user
  would expect.

- Multiple Windows PATH specific issues have been fixed. Also, UNC
  path-names are now supported.

- Make sure RAW+Jpeg files keep the same filename during copy & import.

- Add some consistency on the opacity increase/decrease which was
  working in the reverse order compared to all other mask's controls.

- Invert liquify strength vector rotation for consistency.

- Make metadata and tagging consistent regarding the current selection.

- Fix some rounding errors in masks with sharp corners creating
  discontinuity in the mask area.

- Fix image loader flag which was not properly set at import time.

- Add a search box in presets perferences and shortcuts.

## Notes

- 3.8.x series of darktable releases will be the last supporting running on macOS 10.7 and building with Xcode 11.
  Next major release will require at least macOS 10.14 to run and Xcode 12 to build.

## Changed Dependencies

- Move from Lua 5.3 to 5.4.
