We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.2.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.2.0.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.dmg
??? darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-arm64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-arm64-13.5.dmg
??? darktable-5.2.0-arm64-13.5.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-win64.exe

$ sha256sum darktable-4.8.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 5.0 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 5.0.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.2. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- View snapshots side-by-side with the current image, instead of as a
  partial overlay, by clicking the button next to "take snapshot". The
  center viewport is divided in two equal panels and can be zoomed and
  panned (by dragging while holding the "a" key) as before. The
  dividing line can not be moved and any click without "a" rotates the
  layout.

## UI/UX Improvements

- N/A

## Performance Improvements

- Eliminated unnecessary GUI refreshes.

- Improved user interface responsiveness for blending operations.

## Other Changes

- Due to an upstream issue, exporting JPEG XL in 16-bit float at
  quality 100 is not currently mathematically lossless.

- Allow reading of files in Cineon format (developed by Kodak) and DPX
  format (developed by SMPTE) with .cin and .dpx file extensions.

- Removed prefer performance over quality preference setting.
