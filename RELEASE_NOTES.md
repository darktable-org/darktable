## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.2. These features are described more fully in the user manual and
accompanying blog post.

- New Sigmoid display transform module.

- Two new highlight recovery algorithm are proposed: in-paint opposed
  and segmentation. The in-paint opposed has proved to be very stable
  and good in a lot of pictures so it has been made the default now.

- A full rework of the image display has been done. An initial work
  has been to create an easy to use image display on the central
  area. This routine supports all display mode: focus-peaking and
  color assessment. This routine is now used for the darkroom area,
  for the second window and the duplicates.

  So the second window gets the focus-peaking display and more
  importantly the color assessment mode which is an important feature.

  To achieve that properly a new routine has been created which run a
  separate pixelpipe which is fully equivalent to the darkroom
  one. This gives a properly aligned display.

  Using the new pixelpipe and display routines the snapshot routine
  has been reworked. This new version has fully dynamic snapshots. The
  snapshot can be panned and zoomed and still perfectly aligned with
  the darkroom display which permit a proper comparison.

- Add style preview in lighttable style module and in darkroom style
  widget. The preview is displayed in the tooltip when overing the
  style entries. The tooltip UI has been redesigned at the same time.

- The lens module gains built-in support. Some cameras are recording
  lens correction values into the EXIF. Those data are now retrieved
  and used by the lens module to do the corresponding corrections.

- JPEG XL (read / write)

- Keep modules fully visible when opening or expanding and move with
  a smooth transition effect. The effect can be sped up or switched
  off with preferences/miscellaneous/duration of ui transitions.

- Large pixelpipe cache overhaul. Increased number of cachelines with
  an improved hit-rate while controlling used overall memory leading to
  a significantly faster user interface.

- Rewrite a good part of the slideshow view for better user's
  experience. A small preview is first displayed while computing the
  full image giving feedback that something is happening.

## Other Changes

- Add support for manipulating masks without scrolling (for tablet
  users). The mask manager has been enhanced with a new collapsible
  section containing controls for changing masks properties.

  It is also possible to change a properly shared by a group of mask.

  At the same time the circle and ellipse masks have been enhanced
  with new on-canvas controls to change the size and feather.

- Add WebP read support.

- Embedded ICC profile in exported WebP file.

- A double click on a notebook tab reset all widgets it contains.

- Support regional data/time format in thumbnail tooltips.

- Show lua command in action tooltip.

- Remove SSE code path from White Balance and Color Out modules. The
  optimized code from the compiler gives comparable speed.

- Add support for JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file extension
  which is a standard JPEG.

- The preference to auto-apply a sharpening has been removed. One can
  add an auto-applied presets in the sharpen module and gain the same
  effect.

- Add support for updating existing pictures in Piwigo export.

- The White Balances presets have been migrated to an external JSON file.

- Remove Color Balance layout and White Balance control background
  color from the preference as this can be done directly on the module
  itself.

- Improve profile support for AVIF & EXR format. Also relax AVIF
  reader by not requiring full compliance.

- The current collection image count is now shown in the toolbox. This
  makes this information available even if the top hinter area is
  hidden.

- Try to get color-space for PNG file from the cICP chunk. This was
  added in a recent revision of the PNG spec, so we take advantage of
  it is present.

- The reading of 16-bit half float for TIFF format is now done using
  the Imath library.

- Enable actions on the export format and storage widgets. This means
  that they can be mapped to shortcut.

- Introduce balanced OpenCL vs CPU tiling. This makes it possible to
  use CPU tiling if there is not enough memory on the OpenCL card and
  so would require a lot of tiles to be handled on the card. At the
  end, the large number of tiles plus the overlapping area will make
  the use of the OpenCL code patch slower (or much slower) than
  handling the image without tiling on CPU.

- In preview mode the overlay display block is not shown by
  default. Moving the cursor on the half top of the thumb will display
  it. The block is still hidden automatically after some timeout.

- Set light patterns for Behringer b-control midi rotors
  (BCR2000/BCF2000)

- Fix reading of EXIF metadata when importing EXRs (if desired,
  existing files must be re-imported, refreshing metadata is not an
  option).

- Add support for scrolling through presets with shortcuts.

- The panel size are now using the natual size making the initial
  display adjusting to the screen resolution.

- Allow narrow geo-tagging module. If the panel is getting small the
  widget will properly wrap around instead of ellipse texts.

- Add some more actions in the main help screen (displayed with
  <kbd>h</kbd> key).

- The lensfun module is now a mandatory dependency. This will ensure
  that all darktable build will have the lens correction module. Also,
  an edit with this module won't get lost because a build is missing
  it. At the same time this simplify the code, which is also good.

- A new virtual module <focused> is introduced. This module can hold
  key shortcuts that can be applied to the current module in
  focus. For example a key shortcut in the 1st slider will be usable
  to change exposure in the exposure module or the rotation in the
  rotate and perspective module. It can be configured for sliders,
  comboboxes, buttons, tabs and the focused module itself.
  
- Right-clicking on a module header in the quick access panel allows
  quickly adding more widgets from the same module. The tooltip and 
  icon show if those widgets are currently hidden in the full module.

## Bug Fixes

- Properly use the display color profile in the slideshow. This was
  missing and so images where just ignoring the color profile and were
  displayed (very) differently than on the lighttable or darkroom.

- Properly honor the modules' off status of in a style. Using a style
  in the export module can now be used to disable a module otherwise
  enabled in the history stack.

- Fix bauhaus popup size and position.

- Fix iop-order name on reset.

- Do not display deprecated module actions in preferences' shortcuts section.

- Fix some bauhaus widgets popup positioning on Wayland.

- Fix speed issue when importing large folders with XMP having lot of
  metadata.

- Fix some missing GUI update in the Liquify module. In some cases,
  changing the strength of a node in a curve or line was not properly
  updating the displacement values.

- Fix bad interaction between the color assessment mode and the side
  panels.

- Fix infinity focus display in image information.

- Fix translation of retouch module toast messages.

- When importing we keep the folder or filmroll property if active. If
  another collection mode was selected we use the default filmroll
  one.

- Fix Lab conversion in TIFF import.

- Fix highlights visualization in all recovery mode.

- Fix X-Trans highlight reconstruction visual indicator.

- Fix undo/redo after a style applied via a shortcut.

- Do not rebuilt the whole tree when deleting or editing a
  preset in preferences. This gives a better stability to the UI.

- Fix some refresh of the mask manager when changing images.

- Fix mask selection after a continuous mask creation.

- Fix name and tooltip in demosaic preferences to be correct for all
  sensor kind.

- Remove the automatic check for OpenCL headroom as this was causing
  more problems than it solve.

- Fix non blinking cursor in the processing module search dialog. This
  was making the module looks like it was not active.

- Properly record the libraw black level.

- Fix state of some UI buttons in the retouch module when switch images.

- Fix selection of unaltered images.

- Widgets in collapsed section are not disabled anymore making them
  actionable via shortcut.

- Fix typo preventing proper expansion of variable $(FOLDER.PICTURES).

- Fix PNM loader (could display broken images and always wrong colors).

- Fix drawing color picker area when in image edges. When mouse is
  going outside the edges we don't loose anymore the editing action.

- An old bug in the cache handling has been fixed. This could have
  different effects like missing a recompute of the display after some
  change in parameters or a simple crash when in darkroom.

- Fix some toggle buttons UI state not properly updated.

- Fix check of temperature coefficients for displaying the selected
  presets. This avoid some missed hits.

- Fix fast pixelpipe support in some modules for the second window.
  
- In the quick access panel, widgets are hidden if they are also hidden
  in the full module (due some combination of selected options). This
  even works if those options are changed from another widget in the qap.

## Lua

- API version changed to 9.0.0

- darktable.gui.libs.filter.sort|sort order|rating|rating comparator
  functions removed

- filename removed from dt_lua_snapshot_t data type

- darktable.gui.libs.snapshot now updates the screen after changing
  direction or rotation

- lua snapshot datatype correctly retrieves snapshot name
