## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.4. Most of these features are described more fully in the user manual.

- Allows for multiple presets to be defined and applied automatically
  on matching images. Each preset after the first one will create a
  new module instance just on top of the current module (so it applies
  after).

  To better view which module instance corresponds to which preset the
  module label is set to the preset name. This preset name will be
  changed if some parameters on the module are changed (and so does
  not correspond to the preset anymore). If the module label is hand
  edited it will be kept.

- Rework the module default parameters and make them usable
  in copy/paste, presets and styles.

  Many modules have default parameters based on image metadata or
  current workflow:

  - Exposure: use a specific default in scene referred workflow,
  - Denoise profile: is camera and ISO specific,
  - Lens correction: is camera and lens specific,
  - Base curve: is camera sensor specific,
  - White balance: is metadata specific,
  - Orientation: is metadata specific,
  - Color calibration: is metadata specific.

  For all those modules it is now possible to paste parameters and
  ensure that proper default metadata based will be used. This is
  achieved by selecting the "Reset" corresponding column in the
  preset and style dialog.

  For presets a new option can be selected in the dialog for the
  preset to be using the module's default parameters on which it is
  applied. The option is named "Reset all module parameters to their
  default values"

  This new generic feature has permitted to clean-up some hacks to try
  to do the same kind support at the module levels and which was
  anyway limited.

- Rework the workflow setting, we now have the choice between:

  - Scene-refrerred (Filmic)
  - Scene-referred (Sigmoid)
  - Display-referred (Legacy)
  - None

  The chromatic adaptation preference has been removed and is implied
  by the workflow. The Color calibration module is used when in
  Scene-referred and While balance otherwise.

  Finally, using None workflow and the two new features above
  (multiple presets support and reset to default parameters metadata
  based) one can create any other kind of workflow. For example it is
  possible to use Sigmoid with the White balance module.

- Add support for Color Harmony Guide lines in RYB vectorscope.

  There is 9 color harmony guides proposed:
  - Monochromatic
  - Analogous
  - Analogous complementary
  - Complementary
  - Split complementary
  - Dyad
  - Triad
  - Tetrad
  - Square

  This guides can be used to shift colors of a picture to match one of
  the color harmony. One can see the color harmony guide a bit like
  the composition guides but related to colors and not to composition.

## Other Changes

- Add OpenCL support to the Sigmoid module.

- Do not invalidate snapshot anymore when the history is changed
  (compressed or reset). All snapshot are now stored with their full
  history and can be reconstruct properly.

- Module "Levels" has been deprecated, use "Levels RGB" instead.

- Module "Contrast Brightness Saturation" has been deprecated, use
  "Color Balance RGB" instead.

- Convert the zoom widget on the navigation window to a standard
  drop-down for better fitting the darktable style.

- Lower the ISO 12646 border size still staying in the recommended
  size.

- Rework the preset dialog filter to better show the relation between
  the raw, non-raw and the three formats HDR, monochrome and
  color. This avoids confusions and creating presets that are actually
  not applied.

- The default module group has been removed. It is better to use one
  of the scene-referred group.

- Add support for loading QOI images.

- Redesign the export and thumbnails generation.

  Some hacks have been accumulated to try to have exact size of the
  exported pictures. All this has been redesigned and simplified to have
  a better export size.

- Various code cleanups removing SSE2 specific code with improved
  performance. Some SSE2 code path have been removed in the following
  modules as the current optimized code generated by the compiler is
  faster:

  - Dither
  - Graduated Density
  -

- Improve Highlights reconstruction "inpaint opposed" performance by
  providing an OpenCL implementation and using internal caching in
  darkroom.

- Various improvements of the debug interface:

  - -d common outputs most valuable information and should be used for
     bug reports instead of -d all.

  - --bench-module <modulea,moduleb> does runtime benchmarking of the
      specified modules.

  - --dump-pipe <modulea,moduleb> writes in & output data of the
    specified modules as pfm files for inspection.

- Improve support for Lens correction based on embedded data.

  - Add supports for dng files,
  - Allows finetuning of scale,
  - Add an auto-scale button.
  - Improve overall module performance of about 8%.

## Bug Fixes

- Remove the commit button from the crop module has it was not used
  anymore.

- Fix the reset of modules with specific default parameters to ensure
  that the modules will be set back in the same state as it was when
  first importing the image. This fix is related with the rework of
  auto apply module default parameters in the section above.

- Properly transform XMP regions from metadata to ensure they match
  the image. The XMP regions may come from the camera face recognition
  for example.

- Fix some rounding issues in the calculation of the borders in the
  border module. This creates borders on opposite sides with the same
  size.

- Code maintenance and bugfixes for writing dng files as used in
  "Create HDR"

- Pixelpipe cache safety and performance improvements. This makes
  better hit when looking in the cache and so allow for better
  performances.

- Fix "--threads n" restricts OMP threads to specified number (does
  not allow for more threads than available on the host.

- Raw chromatic aberration module always works on full image data
  so quality is immune to scaling in darkroom mode.

## Lua

### Add action support for Lua

- The lua call to dt.gui.action has become more flexible, with most
  parameters optional, so you can read the focused status of a module
  doing just dt.gui.action("iop/filmicrgb", "focus").

- tooltips show these compacter lua commands in mapping mode (only
  adding the last parameter, instance, if the module supports
  multi-instance) and have been added to presets and styles menus as
  well.

- Lua commands can be copied to the clipboard, using ctrl+v in the
  shortcuts dialog, both from a selected action or shortcut, or long
  right click when in mapping mode (over a widget) or in the
  presets/styles menus.

- The shown/copied lua command for a slider or combobox will set the
  value it currently has.

- A bug with shortcuts (and dt.gui.action) to set the active item in a
  combobox with varying content has been fixed and now it is also
  possible to directly set the values of the combos for the focused
  module's blending mode etc. (by setting the shortcuts effect).

- Added section headers to the sort by drop-down (files, times, etc).

- Shortcuts assigned to presets or styles will be shown when hovering
  over them in their menu.

- Long left clicking a preset will keep the menu open so you can
  quickly switch between several to see the effect without having to
  repeatedly click the preset button to reopen the menu. You can also
  scroll over the preset button to switch to previous/next presets
  (like you already could via shortcuts).

- A shortcut can now be directed to a lua script that mimics a
  standard slider, dropdown or button, but dynamically selects the
  real widget(s) that receive(s) it, based on for example which module
  is focused or enabled. The advantage is that all fallbacks work as
  normal, so you can assign a midi knob to it and turning it (holding
  shift/ctrl to speed up/down) or pressing it to reset work regardless
  of which widget receives it. Basically this is a much more flexible
  alternative to the fake widgets under processing
  modules/<focused>. This allows owners of for example an x-touch mini
  to use their scarce rotors in different, fully configurable, ways
  while working in different modules (which can also be focused using
  midi buttons which will then light up). Such configurations could be
  shared using https://github.com/darktable-org/lua-scripts.

- Support shortcuts to sliders/combos created in lua, either via
  visual mapping mode or in the shortcuts dialog under the lua
  category. Elements and effects are not supported.

### Other Lua changes

- Add image orientation retrieval support.

## Notes

- With the support of JXL, AVIF and EXR for export, selecting specific
  metadata (eg. geo tag, creator) is not currently possible. For
  formats JXL, AVIF and EXR, darktable will not include the metadata
  fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the export
  preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be supported by reverting the following change:
  remove line 241 of darktable.css file on your system. See:
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166
