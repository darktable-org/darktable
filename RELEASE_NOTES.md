Weâ€™re proud to announce the new bug-fix release of darktable, 5.2.1!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.1](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.1).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:
