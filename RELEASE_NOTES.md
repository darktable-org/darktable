We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.2.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.2.0.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.dmg
??? darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-arm64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-4.8.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 5.0 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 5.0.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.
