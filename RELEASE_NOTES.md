As always, please don't use the autogenerated tarball provided by
github, but only our tar.xz file. The checksums are:

When updating from the stable 4.0.x series, please bear in
mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new
library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.0.x.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## The Big Ones


## Other Changes

- JPEG files are identified using magic bytes instead of filename
  extension. This helps in cases where, due to errors in programs or
  user mistakes, JPEG images end up in files with unmatched extensions.

- Allow having shortcuts for quick access styles and presets.

- Add a collapsible section to Sigmoid that will by default hide
  controls not used in standard processing scenarios.

- Some minor modifications on the overlays of culling view to make
  them less intrusive.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix possible bad pinned memory transfer on OpenCL.

- Fix bug in date-time sanitization function that caused image capture
  timestamps to be corrupted when they contained a time zone with a
  negative offset.

- Fix toast messages containing %.

- Fix collect module using exclude rules when first filter is empty.

- Fix RGB curve histogram display when compensate middle grey is set.

- Fix possible infinite loop when a module fails to load.

- Properly honor histogram hiding when restarting.

- Fix darktable-chart crash due to a double free.

- Fix Y0 mask calculations for demosaic module.

- Avoid using fscanf() for loading configuration to avoid broken Windows
  implementation.

- Add RYB vectorscope's option in darktable configuration file to
  ensure proper histogram view setting on startup.

- Ensure that wide popup are properly displayed on the same display as
  the widget.

- Fix possible crash in camera tethering.

- Make yes/no buttons in dialogues to respond to standard shortcuts alt+y
  and alt+n.

- Fix preferences sanitization which was completely un-effective due to
  wrong loading order.

- Add Sigmoid documentation link to the online manual.

- Fix color calibration tooltip on expander.

- Fix incorrect reporting of HEIF image bit depth which resulted in
  wrong color profile selection for images that did not contain color
  profile data.

  switching snapshots slow.
