We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.4.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.4.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.4.0).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.4.0.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.4.0.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.4.0-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-4.8.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.4.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 5.0 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 5.0.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.4. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- A new section Capture Sharpening is added into the demosaic
  module. The capture sharpening tries to recover details lost due to
  in-camera blurring, which can be caused by diffraction, the
  anti-aliasing filter or other sources of gaussian-type blur.

## UI/UX Improvements

- ???

## Performance Improvements

- Tune performance for the Lut3D module (5% to 20% speed-up).

## Other Changes

- Allow using <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier to select only the feather
  points on blend masks. This is sometime needed when the path point
  and the feather point are too close to each others.

- Hierarchical presets are now supported for utility modules as well
  as processing modules.

## Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export module's preference options.

- Starting with release 4.8, macOS versions older than 13.5 are not
  supported.
