library and configuration will no longer be usable with 3.8.x.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## The Big Ones

N/A

## Other Changes

- Variables $(MAKER) and $(MODEL) are now usable at import time.

- Display infinity for very large focus distance as supported by the
  exif standard.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix HDR merge module DNG creation (ColorMatrix could be zero).

- Fix culling layout which could be broken after a second use when
  changing the number of images (rejecting one for example).

- Fix GUI reset of the export module when using the TIFF format.

- Fix copy of iop-order in merge mode when multiple instances are in
  the destination images.

- Fix color filtering issue on Windows.

- Fix possible black screen when using the auto-white balance on
  Windows.

- Properly keep the access and modified timestamps when using copy and
  import.

- Fix color picker reset in color-zone module.

- Fix help link for the module layout management.

- Fix crash after a failed camera tethering attempt.

- Add support for fast pixel-pipe on the diffuse module. In this mode
  the module is just a pass-though. This mode is triggered by modules
  that do not need exact image display but need a fast
  processing. This is mode is used by the crop and perspective
  correction modules for example.

  This is especially important on such a slow module.

- Fix some color picker button action type.

- Fix crash in Latex export.

- Fix web-site gallery support.

- Fix a file handle leak when a dealing with directory and an error
  occurs.

- Fix a memory corruption in sharpen module that could lead to a
  crash.

- Fix vector-scope histogram display to avoid cropping the primary and
  secondary nodes (top and bottom).

- Add HEIF media type association for the desktop.

- Fix possible crash when using the color check without a proper
  selected patch.

- Fix sorting issue of the LUT 3D files and left align the entries for
  better readability.

- Disable upscaling when export size is set to max (0) as this does
  not have meaning and could crash darktable.

- Fix possible crash when applying a time-offset to images.

- Fix crop-size information displayed on screen (rounding issue).

- Fix blending detail mask memory requirement.

- Fix crash when zooming with fingers on an empty lighttable.

- Ensure that external format size limits are enforced during export.

- Some CSS fixes on color, contrast, positioning of combo-boxes,
  check-boxes' size, scroll-bars and progress-bars.

- Fix JPEG APP1 header (skip 6-byte header).

- Fix some missing translations in notebook tabs.

- Use a color managed background for colorbalance rgb module sliders.

- light up midi modifier keys when shift/ctlr/alt are pressed.

- Some speed improvements (tuned compiler options, some optimized
  routines)
