#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

and the changelog as compared to 2.4.0 can be found below.

## New Features

- Allow to select the GUI language in the preferences
- Add a filter rule to the collect module to find locally copied images
- Add favourite toggle to darkroom modules' right click popup
- Allow blending/masking in the hot pixels module
- Add keyboard shortcuts to zoom and pan an image in darkroom. Panning uses the arrow keys, zooming defaults to `ctrl-` and `ctrl+`. Use `alt` and `ctrl` to change the step size of panning.
- Some minor speedups in the grain module
- Handling stdout on Windows: do not redirect stdout for simple command line arguments (`--help` and `--version`)
- On Windows, show the location of the log file in the help message
- Enable searching in the more modules list – click into the list to give focus to it, then start typing. The default GTK shortcut `ctrl-f` doesn't work as it's used for filmstrip already
- Add a debug print when compiling OpenCL kernels

## Bugfixes

- Use the configured overwrite color profile when exporting from Lua – this broke GIMP integration
- Support presets with `<` in their name
- Fix export to non-existing path with `\` as the path separator on Windows
- Don't insist on the db being locked when it doesn't even exist
- Don't touch the mix slider when resetting the curve in color zones
- Fix a bug in the exposure module that would only allow corrections of up to 10eV
- Fix custom shortcuts with `shift` modifier
- Properly ellipsize text in the recently used collections list
- Fix exported galeries with filenames containing a `'`
- Fix finding mipmaps cache folder in `purge_from_cache.sh` script
- Fix a crash in the recently used collections list due to a broken config file
- Set the sqlite threading mode to Serialized
- Fix old export presets using OpenEXR
- Fix building with clang on Windows

## Changed Dependencies

- iso-codes version 3.66 or newer is suggested for a nicer list of translations in the preferences.
