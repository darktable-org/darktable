We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.2.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.2.0).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.2.0.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.dmg
??? darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-5.2.0-arm64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-4.8.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.2.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 5.0 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 5.0.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

for more information on how to contribute._

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.2. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- View snapshots side-by-side with the current image, instead of as a
  partial overlay, by clicking the button next to "take snapshot". The
  center viewport is divided in two equal panels and can be zoomed and
  panned (by dragging while holding the "a" key) as before. The
  dividing line can not be moved and any click without "a" rotates the
  layout.

- The metadata module is now fully configurable and allows to add and
  maintain any tags which are supported by exiv2.

## UI/UX Improvements

- N/A

## Performance Improvements

- Eliminated unnecessary GUI refreshes.

- Improved user interface responsiveness for blending operations.

## Other Changes

- Due to an upstream issue, exporting JPEG XL in 16-bit float at
  quality 100 is not currently mathematically lossless.

- Allow reading of files in Cineon format (developed by Kodak) and DPX
  format (developed by SMPTE) with .cin and .dpx file extensions.

- The "prefer performance over quality" preference setting has been
  removed.

- A workaround for old broken AMD opencl drivers that has been in
  place for 12 years has been disabled by default. Hopefully more
  recent drivers don't need it anymore and it caused problems with the
  translation of the user interface during startup, causing part of it
  to appear in English.  If you have problems with OpenCL that you
  believe may be caused by this change, please do two things:

    - Add the line opencl_force_c_locale=anything to your
      ~/.config/darktable/darktablerc file.

    - If that solves your problem, please report the issue to GiHhub
      PR #18342, including information on the make of your GPU and the
      version of your drivers. We can then for the next release either
      by default reenable the workaround for drivers that need them,
      or warn people with antiquated drivers that they need to update.

- Presets can now be arranged in sub menus, like styles can, by
  inserting | in their name between levels. The shortcuts
  dialog/preferences tab now show these collapsible hierarchies for
  styles and presets too (and the bug that style shortcuts were not
  translated is fixed).

- Give a hint for pending background work when darktable is closing.

- Improved rendering output of denoiseprofile, dither and nlmeans on
  second window or in high quality processing mode.

- Hide "reduce resolution of preview image" preference setting. This
  was a way to get better responsiveness on slow systems introduced in
  2020, but at the same time it was making the color picker and mask
  support inaccurate (quality loss).

- Improved quality of inpaint opposed highlight recovery algorithm for
  sRAW images.

- Reduced haze removal visible difference between exports and HQ
  darkroom processing.

- Lens info is now read from OM-System/Olympus image files taken with
  lenses without electronic data if this info is entered in the
  camera lens info settings dialog. The lens correction module will
  automatically find the lens, if it is supported by lensfun and the
  entered name matches the lensfun name, which can be seen in the lens
  selection drop down list.

- Raster masks got internal improvements and now support the same refinement
  tools as all other masks including details threshold, feathering guide and
  radius, blurring radius and contrast.

- The highlights module offers a raster mask with information about level above
  clip level.

- Changing orientation (via the flip module) respects changes done in crop module.

- In the history module item tooltip, fixed the formatting and scaling
  of the changes to match the values as seen in the modules
  themselves.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed sidecar writing if quitting from darkroom.

- Fixed some rare race conditions while processing the pixelpipes.

- Fixed collection filter presets based on capture time creating an
  empty widget.

- Proper high quality demosaicing and details blending support for
  second window.

- Fixed a bug that allowed NULL pointer dereference in tethering mode
  under certain conditions, which resulted in a crash.

- Fixed darktable shutdown code so pending background jobs are properly finished
  and give a control log if there is pending work.

- Fixed a crash in the import dialog when trying to add a new place to
  an empty places list.

- Fixed bitdepth setting not saved in AVIF export presets.

- Fixed reset button not working in the geotagging module.
