We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.4.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.4.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.4.0).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.4.0.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.4.0.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.4.0-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-4.8.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.4.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 5.0 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 5.0.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.4. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- A new section Capture Sharpening is added into the demosaic
  module. The capture sharpening tries to recover details lost due to
  in-camera blurring, which can be caused by diffraction, the
  anti-aliasing filter or other sources of gaussian-type blur.

## UI/UX Improvements

- Show a busy cursor when changing views. This provides immediate
  feedback when, for example, double-clicking an image in the
  lighttable instead of simply freezing the UI until the darkroom has
  finished opening.

- Added the standard "Window" menu to the application menu bar on
  macOS.

## Performance Improvements

- Tune performance for the Lut3D module (5% to 20% speed-up).

## Other Changes

- Allow using <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier to select only the feather
  points on blend masks. This is sometime needed when the path point
  and the feather point are too close to each others.

- Hierarchical presets are now supported for utility modules as well
  as processing modules.

- Dual demosaicing now works also in tiling mode for possibly better
  OpenCL performance and smaller CPU memory pressure.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed some issues with the hierarchical styles handling in the
  styles module.

- Fixed moving additional extra audio or text sidecar files when
  an image is moved.

## Lua

### API Version

- API version is now 9.5.0

### New Features

- ???

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where changing the image scaling in the export module
  influences the result of a running export job.

- Make sure we always fill the complete main darkroom canvas while
  zooming at large scales.

### Add action support for Lua

### Other Lua changes

- N/A

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export module's preference options.

- Starting with release 4.8, macOS versions older than 13.5 are not
  supported.
