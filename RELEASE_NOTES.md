We're proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.6.0!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.6.0](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.6.0).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.6.0.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.6.0.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.6.0-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-5.6.0-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.6.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 5.4 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 5.4.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
5.6. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- N/A

## UI/UX Improvements

- In the crop module, the crop aspect ratio is added to the dimensions
  in the crop area preview.

- Added the ability to pin any image from the filmstrip in the second
  darkroom window. Images can be pinned directly from the 2nd window,
  via drag&drop from the filmstrip and via keyboard shortcuts. Two
  new actions are the added:
    - Toggle pinned state for currently developed image
    - Pin current image in second view

- Allow switching between point/area color picker directly on canvas
  with a simple Ctrl+Click.

- When moving pictures from a collection we switch to the target
  collection only if we did not change manually to another collection
  during the move and the current collection is now empty.

- When copying pictures from a collection we switch to the target
  collection only if we did not change manually to another collection
  during the copy.

- In Color Calibration module the calibration box is now initialized
  on the current bounding box. That is, if a zoom is effective the
  calibration box will be fully visible and won't require to zoom out.

- Make the slider background darker to gain some contrast making them
  easier to differentiate from the other labels.

- Introduce a condensed mode for the panel's controls widgets. This
  mode is off by default ans can be select in miscellaneous interface
  preference.

- Added a 2-up scope showing both the waveform and vectorscope. This
  allows for a simultaneous understanding of both the lightness and
  chromaticity of an image.

- Support rendering and caching higher resolution (6K or 8K) thumbnail
  or full-screen preview images in lighttable view. Previously, for
  displays larger than a 4K, darktable would render a full-resolution
  preview then downscale it. These higher resolution previews also
  allow for less jumpy zooming in of high megapixel files.

- Increase the resolution of the darkroom view's preview-resolution
  images from 720x450 to 1440x900. This produces better data for
  various situations, including in scopes and the color picker.

## Performance Improvements

- Increased performance for OpenCL guided filter by internal tiling.

## Other Changes

- Enabled shortcuts for some existing buttons in duplicate manager,
  snapshots, and AgX modules.

- Added 2 apertures, f/0.95 and f/1.2, to the aperture section of the
  presets dialogue.

- Added Canon Automatic Lighting Optimizer support for CR3-format
  images.

- Added PNG support (8/16-bit) for external raster masks.

- Removed `Neo` Intel GPU from the Windows blacklist.

- In the styles module, a new option has been added to control the
  preview size in the tooltip. The available options are: no preview,
  default size, and large size.

- Improved debugging option --dump-diff-pipe for those of you
  interested in OpenCL code and debugging.

- Added the possibility to vectorize the bitmap displayed in the
  External Raster Mask module. The vectorized mask is added into the
  Mask Manager module as a path object ready to be used as any other
  masks.

- Remove the (unbound by default) keyboard shortcut to cycle through
  each histogram mode, and within each mode to cycle through its
  options. This was a relic of when there were fewer scopes and they
  were not accessible by shortcuts.

## Bug Fixes

- Properly apply the iop-order when applying a style at export
  time. This also fixes the style preview when flying over styles in
  the style module.

- If a tag category is marked as private, all tags and subcategories
  under it are also treated as private.

- Fix occasional geolocation assignment errors in darktable's locations
  module involving polygon-shaped locations

- Prefetch correctly sized thumbnails when user has display scaling
  enabled.

- Honor the default configuration preference "never" for "use raw
  instead of jpeg from size": for unaltered images, always generate
  thumbnails/previews from embedded JPEGs rather than processing the
  raw file. If you prefer the prior behavior, which processed the raw
  file rather than upscale the embedded JPEG for higher resolution
  thumbnails/previews, use the new configuration option "auto".

- In Quick Access Panel, "go to full version..." now reliably scrolls
  to the correct module.

- In filmstrip, keyboard shortcuts for rating/color labels/reject now
  apply to the thumbnail under the cursor (including overlay elements)
  instead of the currently opened image.

- Fix for usage of incorrect color profiles on secondary monitors on
  Windows.

- Fixed unexpected localization of user's defined preset name and
  properly localize the module name displayed in the preset dialog.

- Fixed a possible transient display of the crawler dialog while the
  splash screen is active.

- Fixed improper mask mode displayed in the mask manager menu.

- Fixed an issue where while creating a mask from mask manager and
  still in creation mode the mask was not following the mouse when
  moving over the darkroom. It was then not possible to place the mask
  at the right position.

- Fixed an issue of style migration. A style created before a new
  module is introduced and integrating a specific module order was not
  properly handled. We now properly migrate the embedded module order
  to ensure all modules are described.

- Fixed an occasional bug that dragging exposure change regions in
  histogram, waveform, or RGB parade scopes would adjust in the
  opposite of the expected direction. This occurred when the user had
  not yet selected a module group containing the exposure module.

- Fixed a bug which showed an extraneous toast message in the center
  view when dragging in the vectorscope.

  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
