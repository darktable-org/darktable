## The Big Ones

- A full rework of the GUI. The whole GUI is now fully
  controlled by [GTK+ CSS rules](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/chap-css-overview.html). There is no more size, color, position in
  Gtk C code. This makes the whole GUI themable. This version comes
  with several themes:

     - darktable                : the default theme

     - darktable-elegant-darker : more condensed fonts
                                  best experience with Roboto font installed

     - darktable-icons-darker   : as elegant, with IOP icons
                                  best experience with Roboto font installed

     - darktable-elegant-dark   : lighter version
     - darktable-elegant-grey   : even lighter version

     - darktable-icons-dark     : lighter version. with IOP icons
     - darktable-icons-grey     : even lighter version, with IOP icons

  Note that the new GUI requires Gtk+ 3.22 or higher to work properly.

- The color picker on the tone curve, color zones and fill light modules,
  as well as the parametric mask controls, now allows you to select an
  area when enabled by using <kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd> on the button.

- Added undo/redo support in lighttable for tags, color labels, ratings,
  metadata, deleted history stack, pasted history stack and applied
  styles.

  IMPORTANT:
  The 'preview' (previously <kbd>Z</kbd>) and 'preview with focus detection'
  (previously <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>) actions are now assigned respectively to
  <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+W</kbd> in order to follow the convention
  of using <kbd>Ctrl+Z<kbd> for the "undo" function.

- A new timeline view has been introduced in the lighttable.

- A new 'culling' mode has been added added to the lightable view. It
  displays a fixed number of consecutive images starting from the first
  selected, and allows you to pan & zoom them. The number of displayed images
  can be set by the user, and they can be navigated with the mouse wheel
  and keyboard.

- A quite extensive rewrite of the lighttable (including the film strip) has
  been made to greatly improve the overall performance.The lighttable is now
  usable on 4K and 5K monitors.

- Added support for the new 'raster mask', a copy of a parametric mask
  which is stable during the whole pixel-pipe.

- The processing order of the pixel-pipe can now be changed by using
  <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+drag</kbd> on the module headers to arrange them relative
  to each other. It is VERY IMPORTANT to understand that this feature is NOT
  for creating a more convenient GUI layout, but for changing the actual
  processing of the image. DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE unless you understand the
  reason behind the default ordering, and have a specific reason to change it.
  The default order is still the correct order for most purposes.

- The color zones module now shows a histogram based on the active ‘select
  by’ channel, and will display the selected range within that channel if the
  color picker is in 'select area' mode. By default, the spline adjustment is
  now similar to the curve controls, allowing you to add and delete nodes, but
  these nodes can still be moved with the old-style size control by selecting
  the 'edit by area' checkbox. There is also a new 'strong' processing option,
  and a new color picker which creates a curve based on selected image area.
  
- A new module 'filmic RGB' which, like the previous 'filmic', is designed
  to replace the 'base curve' and 'shadows and highlights' modules. The new
  version replaces the old one introduced in 2.6.2; it should be easier to use,
  and it will reduce color casts. The old 'filmic' module is now deprecated and
  is only available on images where it was already used for editing.

- A new module 'tone equalizer', designed to replace the 'tone mapping' module,
  brings an easy and safe way to adjust the tones in different areas of the
  image. The module comes with 9 controls (available as fixed sliders or nodes
  on a spline) covering the range from blacks to specular highlights. It also
  features an advanced picker tool which can be moved over the image to make
  tonal modifications to specific areas.

## New Features And Changes

- A new module for handling 3D Lut transformations (PNG Hald-CLUT and
  Cube files are supported).

- Many improvements to the 'denoise (profiled)' module. The degree of shadow
  denoising can be can be controlled, including the correction of color casts
  (mainly improves high-ISO images). An "auto" mode was added which infers
  some parameters from the profile used, and allows users to create presets
  which are adaptive to various ISO values. The default values of the sliders
  are also adapted dynamically on module activation, giving a good trade-off
  between noise smoothing and detail preservation.  The non-local means mode
  has 2 new options: one to coarse-grain denoising, and one to control the
  amount of fine detail to preserve. The controls now have soft boundaries,
  which means that users can use the keyboard to enter values outside the
  range of the sliders if they need to.

- Along with selecting the 'soft proof' color profile, users can now select an
  additional profile for the color space of the histogram, color picker and
  overexposed checker. When gamut or softproof checks are active the histogram
  and color picker use the softproof profile, otherwise they use the new
  histogram profile (which is always used for overexposure checking).

- A new setting for 'working profile' has been added to the input color profile
  module. This color space will be used by RGB modules between the input and
  output color profile modules.

- A new color picker has been added to the parametric masking controls which
  adjusts the range sliders based on the selected area from the image. Click
  to adjust the input image slider, <kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd> for output image slider.

- The 'picasa' target storage in the export module has been completely rewritten
  to support the new Google Photo API, and renamed 'google photos'. It is again
  possible to create albums directly from the export module.

- A new single-line image information display can be positioned at the bottom or
  the top of the darkroom view to replace the information previously overlaid on
  the histogram. The specific information shown can be configured in preferences.

- The 'tagging' module is faster, and can now display hierarchical tags in a
  tree view. Tags can now be designated as 'private' (not exported by default),
  'synonym' (to help search engines), and 'category' (not exported, for organizing
  the tag library). The metadata exported with images can now be configured in the
  'export selected' module, allowing you to choose which main types are exported,
  as well as define values for specific tags based on formulas.
  
- Many code optimizations for CPU and SSE paths.

- A new preference to expand/collapse a darkroom module when it is
  activated/deactivated.

- The 'collect images' module has a new single-click option featuring range selection
  for date-time and numeric values.
  
- The orientation of drawn masks using the 'gradient' shape is now clearly displayed
  with an arrow.

- The 'graduated density' module has better accuracy when computing the
  rotation to avoid sporadic flipping of the gradient.

- Make sure the OpenCL kernel code is recompiled when the driver
  version is updated.

- Add color pickers for 'split toning', 'graduated density' and 'watermark' modules.

- The color picker positions are kept during editing within a module.

- The map view can zoom on the images of the selected collection.

- The slideshow will now start at the selected images if any, and supports
  changing the delay between images. It will also now be more responsive when
  manually moving backward and forward through the images.

- A new 'basic adjustments' module has been added. It allows to adjust
  the exposure, highlight compression, contrast, brightness and saturation.
  It also has an auto feature based on Rawtherapee's auto levels that can
  work on the entire image or a user selected area.

- A new 'rgb curve' module has been added. It has modes for linked and
  independent RGB channels. The curves and histogram can be displayed using
  the working profile or can be scaled to be 50% grey. A secondary color
  picker will add 4 nodes to the curve based on the area selected in the
  image: min, average, middle, and max.

- A new 'rgb levels' module has been added. It has linked and
  independent channels, preserve colors option and is native RGB.

- A new search box has been added to the module groups in the darkroom
  view, with configuration options to show only the module groups, only
  the search box, or both. Modules are searched for by (localized) name,
  and when displaying only the search box, the active modules are shown
  when the box is empty. A shortcut can be set for focusing the box.

- A preview window has been added to the darkroom that displays the edited image
  on a separate window.

- A new option 'skip' is added to the 'on conflict' setting on the export module
  which skips the exporting to existing destination files.

- Allow to select between clone/heal and blur/color modes in 'retouch' module.

- An accels window has been added to summarize all available shortcuts and mouse
  actions available in the current context.

- Dynamic shortcuts have been added for darkroom module sliders. They allow to
  change slider values with an accel + mouse scroll.

- Add zoom & pan feature to lighttable full preview..

## Bug fixes

- The color picker support has been fixed by a complete rewrite. It
  should now give correct values in all cases.

- Fix overexposed display.

- Do not disable SSL for storage modules.

- A long standing bug on mask distort in Liquify module has been
  fixed. This was visible when a liquify mask was used together with
  the perspective correction module activated.

- A bug on mask distort from crop & rotate when using flip and
  some angle has been fixed.

- Fix manual crop in perspective correction module when not in default
  orientation.

- The modification of date/time is now stored into the XMP. This
  ensure that removing the picture and reloading will keep the changes.

- Fix orientation to support all cases as exposed in these examples:
  https://github.com/recurser/exif-orientation-examples

- Store the panel states for each lighttable mode.

- Fix crop&rotate and orientation in the lightroom importer.

## Lua

- The displayed image in darkroom view can now be changed.

- GUI panel visibility can now be queried and changed.

- Lighttable view toolbox (rating filter, rating comparator, sort
  field, and sort direction) can now be changed.

- Lighttable layout and zoom level can now be changed.

- All images containing a specific tag can be searched and returned.
