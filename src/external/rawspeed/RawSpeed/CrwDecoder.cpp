   Construct a decode tree according the specification in *source.
   The first 16 bytes specify how many codes should be 1-bit, 2-bit
   3-bit, etc.  Bytes after that are the leaf values.

   For example, if the source is

    { 0,1,4,2,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
      0x04,0x03,0x05,0x06,0x02,0x07,0x01,0x08,0x09,0x00,0x0a,0x0b,0xff  },

   then the code is

        00                0x04
        010               0x03
