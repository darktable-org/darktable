osm-gps-map is a Gtk mapping widget (and Python bindings) that when given
GPS co-ordinates, draws a GPS track, and points of interest on a moving map
display.

osm-gps-map Downloads map data from a number of websites, including
openstreetmap.org, openaerialmap.org and others and can be used to build
desktop mapping or geolocation applications.
