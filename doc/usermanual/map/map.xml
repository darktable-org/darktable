  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>Map view will show you a world map and pin images that are geotagged into the map. There are
  several processes to get this happen. Some cameras have an internal GPS that tags images with location
  data; such as smartphones. Other cameras such as DSLR needs some additional GPS hardware to do this.
  </para>

  <para>Even if you don't have hardware that supports this: darktable is able to apply GPX track data onto images. While you are
  on a walk and you either have a GPS tracker recording your movements or you use the right app on your smartphone 
  with GPS functionality you can record a GPX track. When you are taking images with your camera on your walk,
  the timestamps of images are stored in EXIF data. They can later be matched with the GPX track data and therefore a location 
  can be estimated. Matching image timestamps with GPX track data can be done from within lightable mode (see <xref linkend="geotagging"/>).

    <para>Map data are taken from open map sources on the internet. New map data are only available if
          you are connected to the internet. darktable keeps a disk cache of already loaded map data.</para>

    <para>You can navigate in your map using the mouse. Left-click will drag the map; using the scroll-wheel
          will zoom in or out.</para>

    <para>Some on-screen controls and displays assist you to find your way. There is a navigation area on top left.
          Use it as an alternative to mouse-dragging and scrolling. The scale of your map is displayed on bottom left.
          On bottom right you see the geographical coordinates of the center of the map.</para>

    <para>Images that already have geo location attributes in their metadata are displayed as small icons on the map.</para>

    <para>In order to assign geo coordinates to an image, activate the film-strip on the lower panel (press <emphasis> Ctrl-f</emphasis>).
          You can simply assign a geo location to an image by dragging the image icon from the film-strip and position it onto
          the map. darktable will record the new geo location (longitude and latitude) as part of the image metadata.
          Exported images will inherit these settings.</para>

    <para>Left and right to the central map there are panels for additional control.</para>
