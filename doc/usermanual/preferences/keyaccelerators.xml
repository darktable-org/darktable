    When you open the shortcuts menu you are presented with a hierarchical list of all actions
    that can receive a keyboard shortcut. Go to the action you want to change and double click.
    You are then prompted to press the new key combination to be mapped to the selected action.
    In order to remove an existing keyboard shortcut, click on the action and press backspace.
