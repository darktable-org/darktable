<sect1 status="draft" id="shortcuts"><title>Shortcuts</title>
  <para>darktable has a big set of keyaccelerators that with the work of Robert Bieber
        now is user configurable through the preference pane.
  </para>

  <para>When you open the shortcuts menu you are presented with a hierarchical list of all actions that
        can receive a keyaccelerator. Go to the action you want to change and double click. You are then
        prompted to press the new key combination to be mapped to the selected action. In order to remove an
        existing keyaccelerator, click on the action and press backspace.
  </para>

  <para>You can export your mappings to a file or import mappings from a file. Press "default" to reset all
        keyaccelerators to their default state.
  </para>

  <para>Here follows a table with the default keybindings of actions available in darktable.
