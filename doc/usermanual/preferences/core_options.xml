  <para>
    These options control some of the internals of darktable.
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">memory in megabytes to use for mipmap cache</bridgehead>

  <para>
    On order to speed-up display of film rolls, darktable stores thumbnails in a cache on disk
    and loads it into memory at startup. This value controls the cache size in megabytes. It
    needs a restart if changed (default 512MB).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">number of background threads</bridgehead>

  <para>
    This controls how many parallel threads are used to create thumbnails during import. On
    32bit systems it is strongly recommended to set this to 1. Needs a restart if changed
    (default 2).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">host memory limit (in MB) for tiling</bridgehead>

  <para>
    In order to manage large images on systems with limited memory darktable does tile-wise
    processing. This variable controls the maximum amount of memory (in MB) a module may use
    during image processing. Lower values will force memory hungry modules to process an image
    with increasing number of tiles. Setting this to 0 will omit any limits. Values below 500
    will be treated as 500. On a 32bit system you should set this to 500. Needs a restart if
    changed (default 1500).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">minimum amount of memory (in MB) for a single buffer in tiling</bridgehead>

  <para>
    If set to a positive, non-zero value, this variable defines the minimum amount of memory (in
    MB) that darktable should take for a single tile. On a 32bit system you should set this to
    8. 64bit systems can live with higher values. Needs a restart if changed (default 16).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">write sidecar file for each image</bridgehead>

  <para>
    These redundant XMP files can later be re-imported into a different database, preserving
    your changes to the image. It's strongly recommended to have this option activated so you
    don't lose data in case of a database corruption. Backing up your RAW file plus the
    accompanying XMP file will allow you to fully restore your work (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">store xmp tags in compressed format</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Entries in XMP tags can get rather large and may exceed the available space to store the
    history stack in output files. This option allows binary XMP tags to be compressed in order
    to save space. Available options are <quote>never</quote>, <quote>always</quote>, and
    <quote>only large entries</quote> (default).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">activate opencl support</bridgehead>

  <para>
    darktable can use your GPU to speed up processing significantly. Interface OpenCL requires
    suitable hardware and matching OpenCL drivers on your system. If one of those is not found
    the option is greyed out. Can be switched on and off at any time and takes immediate effect
    (default on).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">always try to use littlecms2</bridgehead>

  <para>
    If this option is activated, darktable will use system library littlecms2 instead of its own
    routines. This is about 28x slower than the default but might give more accurate results in
    some cases (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">do high quality resampling during export</bridgehead>

  <para>
    The image will first be processed in full resolution, and downscaled at the very end. This
    can result in better quality sometimes, but will always be slower (default off).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">demosaicing for zoomed out darkroom mode</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Interpolation when not viewing 1:1 in darkroom mode: <quote>always bilinear (fast)</quote>
    is fastest, but not as sharp. <quote>at most ppg (reasonable)</quote> is using ppg +
    interpolation modes specified below, <quote>full (possibly slow)</quote> will use exactly
    the settings for full-size export (default <quote>at most ppg (reasonable)</quote>).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">pixel interpolator</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Pixel interpolator used in rotation, lens correction, up- and downscaling; options are
    <quote>bilinear</quote>, <quote>bicubic</quote>, <quote>lanczos2</quote>,
    <quote>lanczos3</quote> (default).
  </para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">password storage backend to use</bridgehead>

  <para>
    The storage backend for password storage. Options: <quote>none</quote>,
    <quote>kwallet</quote>, <quote>gnome keyring</quote> (default none).
  </para>

<!--
<bridgehead renderas="sect4">run indexer</bridgehead>
<para>This will index images in background, so you can search them by similarity (default off).</para>
