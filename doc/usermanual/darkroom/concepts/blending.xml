    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
      By default a module takes its input from the preceding module, performs its calculations
      and handles its output over to the next module in the pixelpipe. On demand you can
      activate an additional step where a module's output is reprocessed with its input before
      giving the result to the next module. This additional processing step is called blending.
      Input and output can be processed with different algorithms, called blending operators or
      blend modes.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each blend mode is further controlled by a parameter called opacity, which can have a
      value between 0% and 100% and defines how input and output image contribute to the final
      result. Typically an opacity value of 0% gives as a result an image that is identical to
      the input image - the module remains without effect. An opacity value of 100% delivers the
      maximum effect of the module with the blend mode chosen.
    </para>

    <para>
      The opacity value can be the same for all image pixels. In this case blending acts
      uniformily on the image. Alternatively you can make opacity values to vary between
      different image locations or pixel values. This is called a mask and gives fine control
      over what parts of an image are affected by a module and to what extent. At your choice
      you may activate a drawn mask or a parametric mask or a combination of both.

    <sect4>

      <title>blend</title>

      <para>
        Blending is activated with this combobox. Depending on the value selected additional
        control elements will show up.
      </para>

      <sect5>
        <title>off</title>
        <para>
          module's output is passed to the next module in pixelpipe without additional
          reprocessing. No further controls are displayed.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>uniformily</title>
        <para>
          reprocessing takes place with the chosen blend mode and opacity value - the same for
          all pixels. Additional controls to select blend mode and opacity value are displayed.
          The default blend mode is <quote>normal</quote> with an opacity of 100%.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>drawn mask</title>
        <para>
          reprocessing takes place with the chosen blend mode and opacity. Additional controls
          are displayed which allow you to draw a mask. If no mask elements are drawn all pixels
          have the same opacity, defined by the opacity slider. If you draw a mask element, e.g.
          a circle, the inner area of the circle will get maximum opacity, surrounded by a
          transition area or border with a gradual decay of opacity and the remaining image with
          an opacity of 0%. Different graphical shapes can be used. See
          <xref linkend="drawn_mask"/> for further details.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>parametric mask</title>
        <para>
          reprocessing takes place with the chosen blend mode and opacity. Additional controls
          are displayed which allow you to adjust the opacity on a per-pixel basis determined by
          pixel values. In previous versions of darktable this was called <quote>conditional
          blending</quote>. See <xref linkend="parametric_mask"/> for further details.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>drawn and parametric mask</title>
        <para>
          this option combines drawn and parametric masks and shows the full set of both
          controls. See <xref linkend="combined_masks"/> to learn how to best use this
          combination.

      <title>Mask combination and inversion</title>

      <sect5>
        <title>invert mask</title>
        <para>
          When <quote>drawn mask</quote> is selected there is an additional combobox to invert
          the mask by switching mask inversion <quote>on</quote> or <quote>off</quote>.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>combine masks</title>
        <para>
          When either <quote>parametric masks</quote>, or <quote>drawn and parametric
          mask</quote> are selected an additional combobox is shown that controls how the
          individual masks are combined to form the final mask. Details on the combination of
          individual masks can be found in <xref linkend="combined_masks"/>.

      <title>Additional controls</title>

      <para>
        When blending with a mask there are some additional options to deal with the final mask:
        you may blur the mask, temporarily disable it, or display it as an overlay image.
      </para>

      <sect5>
        <title>mask blur</title>
        <para>
          Blurring the mask creates a softer transition between blended and unblended parts of
          an image and avoids artifacts. The mask blur slider controls the radius of a gaussian
          blur applied to the final blend mask. The higher the radius, the stronger the blur -
          or set to 0 for an unblurred mask.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>temporarily switch off mask</title>
        <para>
          Sometimes it is useful to visualize the module's effect without the mask taking
          action. You can do so by clicking on the
          <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_module_eye;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center"/>
          symbol, which will temporarily deactivate the mask - the selected blend mode and
          opacity remain in effect. Switch this button on and off to see if the mask is acting
          on the image as intended.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>display mask</title>
        <para>
          Clicking on the
          <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_module_mask;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center"/>
          symbol will display the current mask as a yellow overlay over a black-and-white
          version of your image. Solid yellow indicates an opacity of 100%; a fully visible gray
          background image without yellow overlay indicates an opacity of 0%.

      <title>Texturing an image</title>

      <para>
        The watermark module supports SVG files with embedded images that can be used as a
        texture source. Blending operators then allow control of how that texture is expressed.

                When blending operators were introduced into darktable, a new module named
                <emphasis>highpass</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="highpass"/>) was added. It
                provides a highpass filter of the image to be implicitly used with blending. It
                is used to produce a gritty detailed image and is a method widely used in the
                workflow of other imaging software.

                    This is the original image, pretty heavily processed: first
                    <link linkend="monochrome"> <emphasis>monochrome</emphasis></link>, then
                    some blue <link linkend="splittoning">
                    <emphasis>splittoning</emphasis></link> but as you see it lacks pop in
                    details and is a bit out of focus...

                    Here we applied the highpass filter with the values shown above. You can now
                    see that the details are greatly boosted and we now have a really gritty
