						<entry>This module is able to correct certain lens flaws, namely distortions, transversal
                                                       chromatic aberrations (TCA) and vignetting. It relies on the external library
                                                       lensfun, which comes with correction profiles for many (but not all) common cameras
                                                       end lenses.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>In order to perform lens corrections the module uses EXIF data of your image to identify the specific camera/lens
                      combination and collects the needed correction parameters from a profile in lensfun's database. 
                </para>
		<sect5><title>camera</title>
			<para>The camera make and model as determined by EXIF data. You can overrride this manually and select
                              your camera from a hierarchical menu.
                        </para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>lens</title>
			<para>The lens make and model as determined by EXIF data. You can overrride this manually and select
                              your lens from a hierarchical menu. This is mainly needed for pure mechanical lenses.
                        </para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>photometric parameters</title>
			<para>Corrections additionally depend on certain photometric parameters that are read from EXIF-data: focal 
                              length (needed for distortion, TCA, vignetting), aperture (needed for TCA, vignetting) and focal distance 
                              (needed for vignetting). Many cameras do not record focal distance in their EXIF data; most likely you need 
                              to set this manually. You can override all automatically selected values.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                              If no controls for the three photometric parameters are displayed, this means that no correction profile could
                              be found for the automatically identified camera/lens combination. You may try to find
                              the right profile yourself by searching for it in the menu. If there is no matching profile, visit <ulink url="http://lensfun.berlios.de">
                              lensfun's home page</ulink> and learn how to generate your own set of correction parameters. Don't forget to share
                              your profile with the lensfun team!
                        </para>

		<sect5><title>corrections</title>
			<para>This combobox gives you a choice about which corrections (out of distortion, TCA and vignetting) darktable 
                              shall apply. Change this from its default <quote>all</quote>, if your camera has already done some internal
                              corrections (e.g. of vignetting), or if you plan to do certain corrections with a separate program.
                        </para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>geometry</title>
			<para>In addition to correction of lens flaws, this module can change the projection type of your image. Set this
                              combobox to the aimed projection type, like <quote>rectilinear</quote>, <quote>fish-eye</quote>, <quote>panoramic</quote>,
                              <quote>equirectangular</quote>. 
                        </para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>scale</title>
			<para>This slider allows you to adjust the scaling factor of your image. Pressing the auto scale button (right to the
                              slider) will let darktable find the best fit to avoid black corners.
                        </para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>mode</title>
			<para>The default behavior of this module is to correct lens flaws. Switch this togglebutton to <quote>distort</quote> in
                              order to simulate the behavior of a specific lens (inverted effect).
                        </para>
                </sect5>
		<sect5><title>TCA red</title>
			<para>This slider allows to override the correction parameter for TCA. You can also use this slider to manually
                              set the parameter in case the lens profile does not support TCA correction. Look out for colored seams at
                              features with high contrast edges and adjust this parameter and the following one to
                              minimize those seams.
                        </para>
                </sect5>
		<sect5><title>TCA blue</title>
			<para>This slider allows to override the correction parameter for TCA. You can also use this slider to manually
                              set the parameter in case the lens profile does not support TCA correction.
                        </para>
                </sect5>
		<sect5><title>corrections done</title>
			<para>You will sometimes observe that for a given camera/lens combination only part of the possible corrections 
                              (distortion, TCA, vignetting) are supported by lensfun's profiles. This message box will tell you what 
                              corrections have actually been applied. 
                        </para>
