						<entry>This module is a classical tool in digital photography. darktable's special feature is to
                                                       have this module act in Lab color space. Thus, is offers three independent curves for L, a, and b channels.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>In its default state curves will be straight lines, defined by few anchor nodes. You can move the nodes with your mouse
                      to modify the curve. You can also generate new nodes by clicking on the curve. Up to 20 nodes per curve can be defined.
                      In order to remove a node, move it out of the diagram area. A color picker is activated by pressing 
                      <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_module_picker;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" /> and will show the picked values in
                      the diagram. Numerical Lab values of input and output (see below) at the selected spot are shown on top left of the
                      diagram.
		</para>
		<sect5><title>L-channel curve</title>
			<para>The tonecurve in L-channel works on Lightness. For a better overview a lightness histogram is displayed in the
                              diagram.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                              On the horizontal line is represented the lightness of the input image pixels. The vertical line represents the 
                              lightness of the output image pixels. A straight line does not change anything. 
                              A point above the default diagonal increases the lightness whereas a point under decreases it. Shifting the center
                              of the curve upwards will lighten the image, shifting it downwards will darken the image. An S-like curve will
                              enhance the contrast of the image.
                       </para>

		<sect5><title>a/b-channel curves</title>
			<para>The curves in a-channel and b-channel work on color values. They are only displayed and active if combobox 
                              <emphasis>scale chroma</emphasis> is set to <quote>manual</quote>.
                              On the horizontal line is represented the color channel value of the input image pixels. The vertiacal line
                              represents the color channel value of the output image pixels. Positive a-values correspond to more magenta colors;
                              negative a-values correspond to more greenish colors. Positve b-values correspond to more yellowish colors; negative
                              b-values correspond to more blueish colors. 
                        </para>
                        <para>A straight line does not change anything.
                             Shifting the center of the curve will give the image a color tint: upwards shifting a-channel gives a magenta tint;
                             upwards shifting b-channel gives a yellow tint; downwards shifting a-channel gives a green tint; downwards shifting
                             b-channel gives a blue tint.
                        </para>
                        <para>Increasing/decreasing the steepness of the curves without shifting its center will increase/decrease the color 
                             saturation of the respective channel. With properly defined curves you can excert fine control on color saturation
                             depending on input pixel's colors.
                        </para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>scale chroma</title>
			<para>darktable does an automatic adjustment of color saturation if this combobox is set to <quote>auto</quote>. The level of this
                              adjustment is dependent on the pixel's color values and its L-value modification by the L-channel tonecurve. It is
                              designed to give an overall boost in color saturation if the L-curve gives a contrast boost. Look at blend mode
                              <quote>coloradjustment</quote> to adjust the strength of this effect (see <xref linkend="blending operators"/>). Only if this 
                              combobox is set to <quote>manual</quote>, you can do your own modification of color saturation by the curves in channels a and b.
