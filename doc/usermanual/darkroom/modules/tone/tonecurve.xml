              This module is a classic digital photography tool. Unlike other image manipulation
              software, however, darktable's tone curve acts in Lab color space. Thus, it offers
              three independent curves for L, a, and b channels.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      In its default state, curves will be straight lines, defined by few anchor nodes. You can
      move the nodes with your mouse to modify the curve. You can also generate new nodes by
      clicking on the curve. Up to 20 nodes per curve can be defined. To remove a node, move it
      out of the widget area. A color picker is activated by pressing
      <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_module_picker;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" />
      and will show the picked values in the graph. Numerical Lab values of input and output
      (see below) at the selected spot are shown on top left of the widget.
    </para>

    <sect5>
      <title>L-channel curve</title>
      <para>
        The tone curve in L-channel works on Lightness. For a better overview a lightness
        histogram is displayed in the diagram.
      </para>
      <para>
        The horizontal line represents the input image pixels' lightness. The vertical line
        represents the lightness of the output image pixels. A straight line does not change
        anything. A point above the default diagonal increases the lightness, whereas a point
        under decreases it. Shifting the center of the curve upwards will lighten the image,
        shifting it downwards will darken the image. An S-like curve will enhance the contrast
        of the image.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>a/b-channel curves</title>
      <para>
        The curves in the a and b channels work on color values. They are only displayed and
        active if the <emphasis>scale chroma</emphasis> combobox is set to
        <quote>manual</quote>. The horizontal line represents the color channel value of the
        input image pixels. The vertical line represents the color channel value of the output
        image pixels. Positive a-values correspond to more magenta colors; negative a-values
        correspond to more greenish colors. Positive b-values correspond to more yellowish
        colors; negative b-values correspond to more blueish colors.
      </para>
      <para>
        A straight line does not change anything. Shifting the center of the curve will give the
        image a color tint: shifting a-channel upwards gives a magenta tint; shifting b-channel
        upwards gives a yellow tint; shifting a-channel downwards gives a green tint; shifting
        b-channel downwards gives a blue tint.
      </para>
      <para>
        Increasing/decreasing the steepness of the curves, without shifting its center, will
        increase/decrease the color saturation of the respective channel. With properly defined
        curves you can exert fine control on color saturation, depending on the input pixel's
        colors.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>scale chroma</title>
      <para>
        darktable does an automatic adjustment of color saturation, if this combobox is set to
        <quote>auto</quote>. The level of this adjustment depends on the pixel's color values
        and its L-value modification by the L-channel tone curve. It is designed to give an
        overall boost in color saturation, if the L-curve gives a contrast boost. Look at blend
        mode <quote>coloradjustment</quote> to adjust the strength of this effect (see
        <xref linkend="blending_operators"/>). If this combobox is set to <quote>manual</quote>,
        you can modify color saturation using the curves in channels a and b.

                Tone curve settings. Please note how the center node of our b-curve was shifted
                down to negative values. This gives the image its blue tint.
