                <sect5><title>Display intent</title>
          		<para>Sets the rendering intent for your display. See above for available options.</para>
                </sect5>
                <sect5><title>Output profile</title>
          		<para>Sets the color profile for output/export. Profiles to be used are picked up from $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/out and 
                        $HOME/.config/darktable/color/out, where $DARKTABLE is darktables installation directory and $HOME is your home directory.</para>
                </sect5>
                <sect5><title>Softproof profile</title>
          		<para>Sets the color profile for softproof. Profiles to be used are picked up from $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/out and 
                        $HOME/.config/darktable/color/out, where $DARKTABLE is darktables installation directory and $HOME is your home directory.</para>

          		<para>Softproof is toggled on/off by pressing "s"; this function allows you to preview the image rendered using a 
	        	printer profile, to see how colors will end up on the final print.</para>

        		<para>Likewise Gamut Check is toggled on/off by pressing "g"; this function marks all pixels, which are out of gamut
                        with respect to the selected softproof profile, by showing them in cyan. Softproof and Gamut Check are mutually exclusive modes.</para>

                        <para>Softproof and Gamut Check can be activated at any place in darkroom mode. Only if module "Output color profile" is in
                        focus, you will get the status displayed left below the center image. Especially for Softproof this may raise doubts,
                        if this mode is still active or not. If in doubt press "g", which will switch to Gamut Check and will be 
                        clearly discernible by cyan marked pixels. Press "g" again and you are back to normal display without Softproof 
                        or Gamut Check.
                        </para>  
                </sect5>
                <sect5><title>Display profile</title>
          		<para>Sets the color profile for the display. Profiles to be used is picked up from /usr/share/darktable/color/out and 
                        $HOME/.config/darktable/color/out. The additional option "system display profile" is taken directly from your system's
                        color manager or from your X Server. When working with a calibrated display this is the preferred option to choose.</para>
