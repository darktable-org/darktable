              This module can be used to override darktable's automatic allocation of input
              color profile if there is an alternative that more closely matches your original
              image's color space.

      <para>
        Choose the profile or color matrix to apply, darktable offers many widespread matrices
        along with an enhanced matrix for some camera models. The enhanced matrices were
        processed by the darktable team in order to provide a look closer to the manufacturer's.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also supply your own input ICC profiles and put them into
        $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/in or $HOME/.config/darktable/color/in. $DARKTABLE is
        used here to represent darktable's installation directory and $HOME your home directory.
        One common source of ICC profiles is the software that is shipped with your camera; it
        often contains profiles specific to your camera model. You may need to activate module
        <emphasis>unbreak input profile</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="unbreak_input_profile"/>)
        to use your extra profiles.
      </para>
      <para>
        If your input image is a low dynamic range file like JPEG, or a raw in DNG format, it
        might already contain an embedded ICC profile which darktable will use as a default. You
        can always overrule darktable and select a different profile or select <quote>embedded
        icc profile</quote> to restore the default.
