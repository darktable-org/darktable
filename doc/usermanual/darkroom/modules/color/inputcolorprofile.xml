			<para>Choose the profile or color matrix to apply. darktable offers many widespread matrices along with an enhanced matrix for various camera models. The
                              enhanced matrices were processed by the darktable team in order to provide a look close to the manufacturer one.
			</para>

			      You can also supply your own input ICC profiles and put them into $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/in or
                              $HOME/.config/darktable/color/in. $DARKTABLE is used here as a placeholder for darktable's installation directory and $HOME is your home directory.
                              One common source of ICC profiles is the software that is shipped with your camera; it often contains profiles specific to your camera model. Most likely
                              you need to activate module <emphasis>unbreak input profile</emphasis> in this case (see <xref linkend="unbreak input profile"/>).
			</para>

			<para>If your input image is a low dynamic range file like JPEG it might already contain an embedded ICC profile. darktable will use this as a default on 
                              those images. If you know what you are doing, you can overrule darktable and select a different one. Select <quote>embedded icc profile</quote> to restore 
                              the default.
