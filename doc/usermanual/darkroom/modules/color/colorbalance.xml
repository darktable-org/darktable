    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      For each of the three primary colors - red, green, and blue - there are three sliders
      <quote>lift</quote>, <quote>gamma</quote> and <quote>gain</quote> to control dark tones,
      mid tones and high tones, respectively. Changing these parameters adds offsets to the
      individual RGB channels and influences the color balance of the image.
    </para>

    <para>
      Additional <quote>factor</quote> sliders act on all colors at once. Their effect is
      similar to the controls of the <emphasis>levels</emphasis> module (see
      <xref linkend="levels"/>).
    </para>

    <para>
      The way to best envision the module's way of working is if you consider
      <quote>lift</quote>, <quote>gamma</quote> and <quote>gain</quote> as parameters
      influencing the properties of a tone curve which - in its original state - is a straight
      line going diagonally from bottom left to top right.
    </para>

    <para>
      The lift parameter adjusts the left axis intercept of the line - the intercept can be
      shifted from its default zero value to negative or positive values. The gamma parameter
      modifies the line shape - the default shape is linear and can be turned into a convex
      curve with increased or into a concave curve with lowered gamma values. Finally, the gain
      parameter defines the steepness of the curve - by default the curve runs diagonally,
      higher values lead to a steeper curve and lower values to a flatter one.
    </para>

    <para>
      Side note: although this module acts on RGB colors its location in pixelpipe puts it into
      the Lab color space. Accordingly the modules converts from Lab to RGB, does its color
      adjustments, and then converts back to Lab.

      <title>lift</title>
      <para>
        Increases the value of dark colors with individual sliders for each RGB color and with a
        <quote>factor</quote> slider acting on all three colors at once.
      </para>

    <sect5>
      <title>gamma</title>
      <para>
        Adjusts the mid tones with individual sliders for each RGB color and with a
        <quote>factor</quote> slider acting on all three colors at once.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>gain</title>
      <para>
        Adjusts the high tones with individual sliders for each RGB color and with a
        <quote>factor</quote> slider acting on all three colors at once.
