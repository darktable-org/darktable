						<entry>This module is a classical tool in digital photography. On the horizontal line is represented the lightness of the image pixels.
							The vertical line represents the lightness of the result image pixels. Thus, a straight line does not change anything. 
							A point above the default diagonal increases the lightness whereas a point under decreases it.

	<sect3><title>Usage</title>
		<para>The tonecurve works on Lightness channel only.</para>
		<para>The horizontal axis is split in 5 zones thanks to 4 triangles. Those triangles have a constant vertical value, thus moving them modifies the curve so their output value is kept.</para>
		<para>When your mouse hovers the curve, brighter zone are shown to visualize the degree of liberty you have without damaging too much your image.</para>
