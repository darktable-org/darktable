		<para>Blending is a functionality that works on a per-module basis by reprocessing a module's output with its input in
                      various ways.
		</para>
		<para>Modules that support blending inherit additional controls at the bottom of the module's user interface.
		</para>

                <sect3 status="final"><title>Usage</title>	

		<sect4><title>blend mode</title>
			<para>There are several blend modes implemented and more might be added in future. For now all the common ones are there and
			      you will recognize a few of them from other imaging software. A good introduction on many
        	              common blend modes is given in <ulink url="http://docs.gimp.org/2.8/en/gimp-concepts-layer-modes.html">
                              <emphasis>The Gimp Manual (Chapter 8.2, <quote>Layer Modes</quote>)</emphasis></ulink>. Therefore we only discuss a few blend modes here in more detail.
			</para>

			<sect5><title>off</title>
				<para>If blend mode is set to its default <quote>off</quote> value no blending will be done and all other blending related controls are hidden.
			        </para>			
			</sect5>


			<sect5><title>normal</title>
				<para>This will probably be the most used blend mode. It just mixes input and output and therefore 
				      reduces the strength of a module's effect.
			        </para>			
			</sect5>

		        <sect5><title>inverse</title>
				<para>This blend mode acts similarly to blend mode <quote>normal</quote>, only that the role of input and output of the
        	                      current module are reversed. Tip: This can be used together with conditional blending (<xref linkend="conditional_blending"/>) to
        	                      get the effect of an inversed blend mask.
        	                </para>			
			</sect5>

			<sect5><title>unbounded</title>
				<para>This blend mode acts similarly to blend mode <quote>normal</quote>, except that input and output data are not
        	                      clamped to a particular min/max value range unlike all other blend modes which do
        	                      clamp their input and output. In some cases (e.g. highly color saturated extreme highlights) it is 
        	                      important to  let unbound values travel through the pixelpipe in order to properly deal with them at 
        	                      the right place (e.g. in module <link linkend="output_color_profile"><emphasis>output color profile</emphasis></link>).
	                        </para>			
	                </sect5>

			<sect5><title>lightness</title>
				<para>This blend mode mixes lightness from the input and output images. Color data (chroma and hue) are
	                              taken unaltered from the input image.
	                        </para>			
	                </sect5>


			<sect5><title>chroma</title>
				<para>This blend mode mixes chroma (saturation) from the input and output images. Lightness and hue are
	                              taken unaltered from the input image.
	                        </para>			
	                </sect5>

			<sect5><title>hue</title>
				<para>This blend mode mixes hue (color tint) from the input and output images. Lightness and chroma are
	                              taken unaltered from the input image. Caution: When modules drastically modify hue (e.g. when generating
	                              complementary colors) this blend mode can result in strong color noise.
	                        </para>			
	                </sect5>

			<sect5><title>color</title>
				<para>This blend mode mixes color (chroma and hue) from the input and output images. Lightness is
	                              taken unaltered from the input image. Caution: When modules drastically modify hue (e.g. when generating
	                              complementary colors) this blend mode can result in strong color noise.
	                        </para>			
	                </sect5>

			<sect5><title>coloradjustment</title>
				<para>Some modules act predominantly on the tonal values of an image but also perform some color saturation adjustments,
                                      e.g. module <link linkend="levels"><emphasis>levels</emphasis></link> and <link linkend="tone_curve">
                                      <emphasis>tone curve</emphasis></link>. This blend mode takes the 
                                      lightness only from output data and mixes colors from input and output enabling control of the module's 
                                      color adjustments.
	                        </para>			
	                </sect5>

		<sect4><title>opacity</title>
			<para>This slider controls the amount of blending. A value of 100% gives the module's full effect into the
        	              pixelpipe; a value of 0% means no effect of this module. With blend mode <quote>normal</quote> 
        	              opacity controls the strength of a module's effect.
			</para>

	        </sect4>

	        <sect4><title>blend if</title>
        	        <para>Most modules offer additional control with a user-defined blend mask. In order to activate these
			      controls you need to switch from <quote>blend uniformly</quote> to <quote>blend only, if..</quote>. More details on conditional blending
        	              are given in a separate chapter (<xref linkend="conditional_blending"/>).
        	        </para>

		<sect3 status="final"><title>Examples</title>
			<sect4><title>Texturing an image</title>
				<para>The watermark module supports SVG files with embedded images that can be used as a texture source. Blending operators then allow
                                      control of how that texture is expressed.

                                                                       (see <xref linkend="highpass"/>) was added. It provides a highpass filter of the image to be implicitly
