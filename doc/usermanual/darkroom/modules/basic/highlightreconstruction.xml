              This module tries to reconstruct color information that is usually clipped because
              of incomplete information in some of the channels. If you do nothing, your clipped
              areas are often toned to the not clipped channel. For example, if your green and
              blue channels are clipped, then your image will appear red in the clipped areas.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      You can choose between three methods for highlight recontruction.
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>Clip highlights</quote> analyses each pixel having at least one channel clipped.
      Then it sets all channels to the minimum value found among the channels. Effectively this
      converts all clipped highlights to neutral grey tones. This method is most useful in cases
      where clipped highlights occur in non-colored areas like clouds in the sky.
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>Reconstruct in LCh</quote> analyses each pixel having at least one channel clipped
      and transforms the information in LCh color space to linearly mix the channels. This
      method is not able to reconstruct any color information&nbsp;&ndash; the reconstructed
      highlights will all be neutral grey. This works fairly well with a high-contrast base
      curve (such as most manufacturers apply to their jpg), which renders highlights
      desaturated. This method is a good option on naturally desaturated things such as clouds.
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>Recontruct color</quote> uses an algorithm that transfers color information from
      the unclipped surrounding into the clipped highlights. This method works very well on
      areas with homogeneous colors and is especially useful on skin tones with smoothly fading
      highlights. It has fail cases where it produces maze-like artifacts at highlights behind
      high-contrast edges, such as fine, well-exposed structures in front of overexposed
      background (for instance ship masts or flags in front of the blown-out sky).
    </para>

    <para>
      Tip: for highlight reconstruction to take effect you need to apply a negative EV
      correction in the exposure module (see <xref linkend="exposure"/>). If you want to avoid a
      general darkening of your image you can use darktable's mask feature in that module to
      limit the EV correction to only the highlights (see <xref linkend="drawn_mask"/> and
      <xref linkend="parametric_mask"/>).
    </para>

    <sect5>
      <title>clipping threshold</title>
      <para>
        Manually adjust the clipping threshold against magenta highlights. The default is
        usually satisfactory without any need for additional adjustments.
