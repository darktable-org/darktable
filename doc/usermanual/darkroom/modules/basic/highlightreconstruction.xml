              This module tries to reconstruct color information that is usually clipped because
              of incomplete information in some of the channels. If you do nothing, your clipped
              areas are often toned to the not clipped channel. For example, if your green and
              blue channels are clipped, then your image will appear red in the clipped areas.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <sect5>
      <title>method</title>
      <para>
        You can choose between two methods: clipping highlight or reconstructing in LCh.
        Clipping highlight analyses each pixel having at least one channel clipped. Then it sets
        all channels to the minimum value found among the channels. Reconstruct in LCh analyses
        each pixel having at least one channel clipped and transforms the information in LCh
        color space to linearly mix the channels.

      <title>clipping threshold</title>
      <para>
        Manually adjust the clipping threshold against magenta highlights. The default is
        usually satisfactory without any need for additional adjustments.
