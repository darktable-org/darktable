						<entry>This module tries to reconstruct color information that is usually clipped 
            					because of the information being not complete in all channels.
						If you do nothing, your clipped areas are often toned to the not clipped channel.
						For example, if your green and blue channels are clipped, then your image will appear red in the clipped areas.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<sect5><title>method</title>
			<para>You can choose between two methods: clipping highlight or reconstructing in LCh.
			      Clipping highlight analyses each pixel having at least one channel clipped. Then it sets all channels to the minium value found among the channels.
			      Reconstruct in LCh analyses each pixel having at least one channel clipped and transforms the information in LCh color space to linearly mix the channels.</para>
