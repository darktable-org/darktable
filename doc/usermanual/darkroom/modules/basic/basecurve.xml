	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>The basecurve works in camera linear RGB. It is defined by two or more nodes. You can click on any node and drag to adjust; you can also
		      create additional nodes by clicking on a curve segment between two nodes. In order to remove a node drag it outside of the diagram area.
                </para>
