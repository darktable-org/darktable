              Camera sensors provide data in linear RGB format, the original image appears flat
              and dull. That's the reason why camera manufacturers apply their characteristic
              base curves to the RAW data when they generate in-camera JPEG images with better
              colors and contrast. darktable comes with base curve presets that mimic the curves
              of various manufacturers. These are automatically applied to RAW images according
              to the manufacturer ID found in EXIF data.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      You can adjust an existing base curve or create a new one. The base curve is defined by
      two or more nodes. You can click on any node and drag to modify it. You can also create
      additional nodes by clicking on a curve segment between two nodes. In order to remove a
      node drag it outside of the widget area.

      Tip: If you intend to take full manual control of the tonal values with the <emphasis>tone
      curve</emphasis> module or the <emphasis>zone system</emphasis> module (see
      <xref linkend="tone_curve"/> and <xref linkend="zone_system"/>) it may be easier to leave
      the image in linear RGB. Disable the <emphasis>base curve</emphasis> module in this case.

        This combobox toggles between <quote>linear</quote> and <quote>logarithmic</quote> view.
        In the double logarithmic view more space is given to the lower values allowing a more
        fine-grained adjustment of the shadows.
