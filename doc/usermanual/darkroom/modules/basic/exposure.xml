              This module is used to tweak the exposure. It is directly linked to the histogram
              panel. Indeed, if you correct exposure graphically, using the <emphasis>histogram
              </emphasis> (see <xref linkend="histogram"/>), you automatically activate the
              exposure module. The histogram simply acts as a view for the exposure module.

    <para>
      You can activate multiple instances of this module each with different parameters acting
      on different parts of the image which you select by a drawn mask (see
      <xref linkend="multiple_instances"/> and <xref linkend="drawn_mask"/>). The histogram is
      always linked to the lowest instance in pixelpipe.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      This module is responsible for one of the most basic steps in each raw image development.
      An exposure adjustment value allows you&nbsp;&ndash; within certain limits&nbsp;&ndash; to
      correct for under- or overexposure. A shift by 1EV is equivalent to a change of exposure
      time by a factor of 2.
    </para>

    <para>
      Positive exposure corrections will make the image brighter. As a side effect noise level
      gets higher. Depending on the basic noise level of your camera and the ISO value of your
      image, positive exposure compensations with up to 1EV or 2EV still give reasonable
      results.
    </para>

    <para>
      Negative exposure corrections will make the image darker. Given the nature of digital
      images this can not correct for fully blown out highlights but allows to reconstruct data
      in case that only some of the RGB channels are clipped (see also
      <xref linkend="highlight_reconstruction"/>).
    </para>

    <para>
      A black level adjustment is a basic tool to increase contrast and pop of an image. The
      value defines at what threshold dark gray values are cut off to pure black. Use with care
      as the clipped values can not be recovered in other modules further down the pixelpipe.
      Please also have a look at the <emphasis>tone curve</emphasis> module (see
      <xref linkend="tone_curve"/>) and the <emphasis>levels</emphasis> module (see
      <xref linkend="levels"/>) which can produce similar results with less side effects as they
      come later in pixelpipe.
    </para>

    <para>
      The exposure module has two modes of operation.
    </para>

    <para>
      In <quote>manual</quote> mode you directly define the value for exposure correction that
      you want to apply to your image.
    </para>

    <para>
      In <quote>automatic</quote> mode darktable analyses the histogram of your image. You
      select a reference point within the histogram as a <emphasis>percentile</emphasis> and
      define a <emphasis>target level</emphasis>&nbsp;&ndash; darktable automatically calculates
      the exposure compensation that is needed to shift the selected position to that target
      value. The black level adjustment is the same as in manual mode. Automatic adjustment is
      only available for raw images. A typical use case is deflickering of
      <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse_photography"><emphasis>time-lapse
      photographs</emphasis></ulink>. You apply an automatic exposure correction with the same
      set of parameters to all images of the series&nbsp;&ndash; differences in lighting get
      compensated so that the final video sequence does not show any flickering.
    </para>

    <sect5>
      <title>mode</title>
      <para>
        Defines the mode of operation. Defaults to <quote>manual</quote>.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>black</title>
      <para>
        Adjust the black level in both <quote>manual</quote> and <quote>automatic</quote> mode.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>exposure</title>
      <para>
        Adjust the exposure correction [EV] (only available in <quote>manual</quote> mode).
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>auto</title>
      <para>
        Activating this checkbox makes darktable calculate a correct exposition for the
        rectangular view appearing in the centre of the image. You can draw your own selection
        using your mouse. An adjustment slider right to the auto exposure checkbox lets you
        define what percentage of bright values are to be clipped out in the calculation. This
        feature is not to be confused with the <quote>automatic</quote> mode of this exposure
        module and is only available in <quote>manual</quote> mode.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>percentile</title>
      <para>
        Defines a location in the histogram for automatic exposure correction. A percentile of
        50% denotes a position in the histogram where 50% of pixel values are below and 50% of
        pixel values are above. For more details see
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"><emphasis>percentile</emphasis>
        </ulink>. Only available in <quote>automatic</quote> mode.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>target level</title>
      <para>
        Defines the target level for automatic exposure correction in terms of [EV] relative to
        the white point of the camera. The white point is camera specific and defines the
        highest lightness value that the camera sensor can detect. Only available in
        <quote>automatic</quote> mode.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>histogram of</title>
      <para>
        Defines what image data to take as a histogram for the <quote>automatic</quote> exposure
        correction&nbsp;&ndash; either <quote>pre-processed image</quote> which is the input
        that the exposure module receives with some modules like <emphasis>demosaic</emphasis>
        and <emphasis>white balance</emphasis> already applied, or <quote>source raw
        data</quote> which is the unprocessed data of your raw file. Note that this option does
        not relate to the histogram you see in the <emphasis>histogram</emphasis> panel (see
        <xref linkend="histogram"/>)&nbsp;&ndash; the latter representing the final result of
        the pixelpipe with <emphasis>all</emphasis> the active modules being applied.
