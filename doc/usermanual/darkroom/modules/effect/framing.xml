						<entry>This module is an artistic feature to generate a frame around your image. The frame consists of a border with a user defined
                                                       color and a frame line inside that border, which has another user defined color. There are various options for you to control the
                                                       geometry of your frame.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<sect5><title>Border size</title>
			<para>This slider controls the size of the frame in percent of the underlying full image.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Aspect</title>
			<para>With this combobox you can choose between different aspect ratios for the final output of this module, i.e. underlying image plus frame.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Orientation</title>
			<para>If you select a non-square aspect ratio this combobox defines the orientation - portrait or landscape. Set to "auto" if you want darktable to
                              select the most reasonable orientation based on the underlying image.
                        </para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Horizontal position</title>
			<para>Select from a set of pre-defined ratios where you want your underlying image be positioned on the horizontal axis. You can also right click and enter
                              your own ratio as "x/y".
                        </para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Vertical position</title>
			<para>Select from a set of pre-defined ratios where you want your underlying image be positioned on the vertical axis. You can also right click and enter
                              your own ratio as "x/y".</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Frame line size</title>
			<para>The percentage of the frame line size relative to the border size at its smallest part.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Frame line offset</title>
			<para>Where the frame line is positioned relative to the underlying image. Select 0 for a frame line touching the image, 100% for a frame line touching the
                              outer border limits.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>Border color</title>
			<para>Clicking on the colored field will open a color selector dialog which allows to define a color for the border in HSL or RGB color space.
                              You can also activate a color picker by pressing <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_module_picker;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" />
                              and take a color probe from your image.</para>
