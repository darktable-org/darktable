		<para>Each modules is shown as a small icon and the module name.
		Left-click with your mouse to toggle a module's status: visible, hidden or favorite. Favorite modules are indicated by 
                a star in front of the icon and will additionally to their normal module group show up in module group 
                <link linkend="modulegroups"><emphasis>favorites</emphasis></link>.
                This is a good way to get fast access to modules that you use very frequently. Visible modules are indicated in the list
                by a light grey background. Hidden modules have a dark grey background; they will not display any controls whatsoever.

                <para>Hiding or un-hiding modules is not meant to be part of your daily workflow. You should normally only once decide on the 
                modules you typically use, and only come back here later if you miss anything.</para>
