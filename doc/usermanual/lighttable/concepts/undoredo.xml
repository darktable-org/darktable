    <para>
      Most changes in the lighttable are recorded and can be
      reverted. This includes modifications to color labels, ratings,
      geo-localization, tags, metadata, orientation, copy/paste of
      history, or application of a style.  Thanks to this recording,
      it is possible to undo changes or redo them to recover a
      previous state. Note that this undo/redo facility is unlimited
      in the number of steps while in the lighttable, but it is reset
      each time the view is switched (going to the darkroom for
      example).
