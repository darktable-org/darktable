  <para>
    With filtering you limit the number of displayed images in your current collection (see also
    <xref linkend="collect_images"/>). Filtering is mainly based on the star ratings of your
    images. A typical filtering rule will show all images that have a rating at or above the
    given number of stars (from one to five). The comparison operators is not restricted to
    <quote>&ge;</quote>. By clicking on the operator field you toggle between
    <quote>&ge;</quote>, <quote>&gt;</quote>, <quote>&ne;</quote>, <quote>&lt;</quote>,
    <quote>&le;</quote>, and <quote>=</quote>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Alternatively you can make darktable display <quote>all</quote> images, only the
    <quote>unstarred</quote> ones, only the <quote>rejected</quote> images and all but the
    rejected ones.
  </para>

  <para>
    Images in the lighttable view can be displayed in different sort orders, depending on
    <quote>filename</quote>, <quote>time</quote> (when the photo was taken),
    <quote>rating</quote> (i.e. stars), <quote>id</quote> (an internal ordering number of
    darktable), <quote>color labels</quote>, <quote>groups</quote>, <quote>full path</quote>,
    <quote>title</quote>, <quote>description</quote>, <quote>aspect ratio</quote> or
    <quote>custom order</quote> (user can drag &amp; drop images, only available in the
    lighttable's file manager mode). You can sort in reversed order by toggling the
    triangle button to the right of the <quote>sort by</quote> combobox.
