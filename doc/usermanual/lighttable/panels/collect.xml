            The current view in lighttable is called a collection. With this panel you can
            manage the collection by filtering with different criteria.

  <para>
    All images imported into darktable are kept in a database with various attributes describing
    each image. A collection is defined by applying certain filtering rules to these attributes
    which leads to a subset of your images being displayed in the lighttable view.
  </para>

  <para>
    The default collection is based on the film roll attribute - it displays all images of the
    last imported film roll or any other film roll chosen.

      <title>search rules</title>

      <para>
        In the text field to the right of the attribute you supply a pattern. The pattern is
        compared against all database entries of the selected attribute. A match is detected if
        the pattern is a substring of the image's attribute. You may use <quote>%</quote> as
        wildcard character. The collection gets limited to those images where the query matches.
        Leaving the text field empty matches all images.
      </para>

      <para>
        The table below the search rule will show all matching database entries of the query you
        are currently working on. The table gets updated continuously as you type. You may
        scroll through the list and select the data of your choice by double-clicking.
      </para>

      <para>
        Clicking on the triangle button right to the text field opens a drop-down menu with
        options to finetune your collection by adding further rules:
      </para>

      <sect5>
        <title>clear this rule</title>
        <para>
          Removes this rule - or resets to default if this is the only rule defined.

      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>narrow down search</title>
        <para>
          Adds a new rule which is combined with the previous rule(s) in a logical
          <emphasis>AND</emphasis> operation. An image is only part of the collection if it
          additionally fulfills the added rule.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>add more images</title>
        <para>
          Adds a new rule which is combined with the previous rule(s) in a logical
          <emphasis>OR</emphasis> operation. Images that fulfill the new rule are added to the
          collection.
        </para>
      </sect5>

      <sect5>
        <title>exclude images</title>
        <para>
          Adds a new rule which is combined with the previous rule(s) in a logical
          <emphasis>EXCEPT</emphasis> operation. Images which are selected by the new rule are
          exempted from the collection.

      <title>combining rules</title>

      <para>
        The logical operators defining the combination of rules are displayed to the right of
        the rule: <emphasis>AND</emphasis> by the
        <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_lighttable_and;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" />
        symbol, <emphasis>OR</emphasis> by the
        <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_lighttable_or;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" />
        symbol, and <emphasis>EXCEPT</emphasis> by the
        <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_lighttable_except;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" />
        symbol. Clicking on either symbol gives a choice to change the logical operation.
