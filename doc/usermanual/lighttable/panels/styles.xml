					<entry>This panel lets you use a powerful functionality of darktable: to store and apply a history stack.
					Styles are created in darkroom mode thanks to a button placed below the history stack.
					Then they are managed within this panel, that allows you to apply and delete a style.

		<sect4><title>create duplicate</title>
			<para>When applying a style on selected images, activating this box lets you create a duplicate before applying the styles. 
			      De-activate this option if you want to try various styles; this will avoid that you create multiple duplicates.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>edit</title>
			<para>Styles are a collection of history stack items. After pressing edit you are prompted with a dialog in which you can deselect
                                            specific items. Check option "duplicate" if you want to create a new style instead of overwriting the existing
                                            one; you need to give a new style name in this case.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>delete</title>
			<para>This will delete the selected style without further question.
			</para>
		</sect4>
