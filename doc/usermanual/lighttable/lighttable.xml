			</para>
			<para>At the bottom you have an option to choose between zoomable lighttable view or filemanager view of the thumbnails.
			In zoomable lighttable view, scroll with your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
			Moving the mouse while <emphasis>pressing the left mouse button</emphasis> allows you to navigate through your collection.
			In filemanager view, you can can change the number of images in each row, using the slider next to the filemanager option,
                        or by using <emphasis>ctrl-(mouse wheel)</emphasis>.
			Use your mouse wheel to navigate through your collection.
			</para>
			<para>While in filemanager mode, you can scroll (not select) up and down through your collection using &uarr;/&darr;.
				In zoomable lighttable &larr;/&rarr;/&uarr;/&darr; allow you to move left/right/up/down through your collection.
				Pressing <emphasis>g</emphasis> goes to the top, <emphasis>shift-g</emphasis> to the bottom.
			</para>
			<para>To locate where you are in a collection, there are indicators at the extreme borders of the window: left/right for your position when
                              you are in filemanager mode, left/right and top/bottom for your vertical and your horizontal position, respectively, when you are in
                              zoomable lighttable view.
                        </para>

		<sect2 status="draft" id="filtering and sort order"><title>Filtering and sort order</title>
			<para>The filtering and sort order of images in the lighttable are accessed and changed in the top bar.
				You can select among a few predefined filters, and ordering like <quote>date</quote>, <quote>color labels</quote>
                                or <quote>rating</quote>.

		<sect2 status="draft" id="image grouping"><title>Image grouping</title>
			<para>Grouping images helps improve structure and clarity of your image collection when 
                              displayed in lighttable view.
			</para>
                        <para>You can combine images into a group by selecting them, and  
                              clicking the <quote>group</quote> button in the <emphasis>selected image(s)</emphasis> panel (<xref linkend="selected images"/>), or by typing 
                              <emphasis>ctrl-g</emphasis>. Likewise, you can remove selected images from a group by clicking
                              the <quote>ungroup</quote> button, or typing <emphasis>shift-ctrl-g</emphasis>. Images generated by 
                              duplicating an existing one, are automatically grouped. If you import 
                              images from the file system or camera, images with the same base name, but different 
                              extensions (eg. IMG_1234.CR2 and IMG_1234.JPG), will form a group. Images which are members
                              of a group are labeled with a <quote>G</quote> symbol in their thumbnails. 
                        </para>
                        <para>The group button <inlinegraphic  fileref="images/lighttable_icon_group.png" scalefit="1" width="2%"/> 
                              in the top panel of the lightroom view toggles grouping mode on and off.
                              If grouping is off, each image is displayed as an individual thumb.
                              If grouping is on, images of a group are collapsed, which means they are 
                              represented by one thumbnail.
                              The image you see is called the group head. If you press <quote>G</quote> symbol in the thumbnail of a group, only this
                              group gets expanded; if another group was expanded at that time, it gets collapsed. To collapse an expanded 
                              group again, just click on the <quote>G</quote> symbol of its group head.
                        </para>
                        <para>You can define which image constitutes the group head, while in an expanded view of a group, 
                              clicking on the <quote>G</quote> symbol of the desired image.
                        </para>
                        <para>If you are in collapsed view, and enter darkroom mode with an image group (eg. by 
                              double-clicking on the thumbnail), only the group head will be opened.
                        </para>
                        <para>Image groups are a convenient way to protect an existing history stack against unintentional changes. Suppose you have 
                              just finalized an image; all you need to do now is generate a duplicate, make sure grouping is
                              switched on, and the group collapsed. Whenever you open the image group again in darkroom, 
                              only the group head will be altered. The underlying duplicate remains unchanged. 
                              Please note that duplicating images only means that a second copy of your history stack, and a second small 
                              XMP file, is generated. There still is only one RAW file, so you don't waste a lot of disk space.
                        </para>
