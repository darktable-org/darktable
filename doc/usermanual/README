All invocations of 'make' have to be done inside of your build/ dir after running cmake!

Building manual
---------------------------------------------------------
To build the usermanual you need to install the following tools:
  xsltproc (plus optionally saxon), fop and gnome-doc-utils (for xml2po)

XSLT processor saxon is able to give a nicely looking html usermanual with
correctly displayed images and screenshots. If saxon is not found, xsltproc
will be used as a fallback. Expect inconsistent screenshot and image dimensions in
that case.


Writing guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
There are some format rulings and you easily can following it by copy an already existing
docbook file such if you are going to write a new example use darkroom/examples/crossdeveloping.xml
as a template for your own example.

Do NOT change table layouts etc. we want the document consistent!

Each section should be tagged with status "draft" <sect2 status="draft" id="...">...</sect2>
when someone have reviewed your section you should change status to "final" to get
the section into final usermanual document and also the translators will get this text for
translations.

Make sure to assign an id="..." for every <chapter> and <sect[0-9]>. Those are used to generate the
filenames for the HTML output and also for link anchors inside those files. Also don't change ids as
that will break existing links from all over the Internet into our usermanual!

You can check for uniqueness of ids with this command:

grep -r "id=\"" | sed 's/.*id="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | grep -v "^[ ]*1"



Building the usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------
To generate the usermanual you need the tools xsltproc,poxml and fop this document will include
draft sections and is used fo reviewing...

make darktable-usermanual



Building the final usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------
Generating a final usermanual which would not include the sections with status "draft" this
is for producing a manual for distribution...

make darktable-usermanual-final.pdf



Building the translated manual
--------------------------------------------------------
When building a translated manual all chapters are included, also sections with status "draft" will occur.

make darktable-usermanual-<language code>



Translators
--------------------------------------------------------
To add you language just edit po/LINGUAS and add your language code. Make sure to rerun cmake after this change.

For updating the po file just enter the build directory and execute

make update-usermanual-<language code>
