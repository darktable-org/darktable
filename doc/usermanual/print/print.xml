    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
      This view is about printing&nbsp;&ndash; or the joy of giving birth to a photograph which
      can be put on the wall. Because printing is not easy, there are many technical aspects to
      be taken into account.
    </para>

    <para>
      After selecting an image in the lighttable view (see
      <xref linkend="lighttable_overview"/>) one can enter the print module where there are
      several options for the print layout and for selecting which printer to use.
    </para>

    <para>
      The central area displays the image layout on the paper (the white area). Some gray
      borders may be displayed around the image to represent the printable area (the page minus
      the borders) not filled by the image.
    </para>

    <para>
      On the left side you find the <emphasis>collect images</emphasis> panel which is described
      in more detail in <xref linkend="collect_images"/>. This panel lets you define which
      images are present in the filmstrip. Visibility of the filmstrip&nbsp;&ndash; located in
      the bottom panel&nbsp;&ndash; is toggled by pressing <emphasis>ctrl-f</emphasis> (see
      <xref linkend="filmstrip_overview"/>). On the left side you also have an <emphasis>image
      information</emphasis> panel which displays useful Exif data of the image in the center
      area, or the filmstrip image under the pointer, respectively (see
      <xref linkend="image_information"/>).
    </para>

    <para>
      On the right panel the print settings module has many options to layout the image on the
      page, select the paper, options for exporting, etc. This module is described in depth in
      the section below.
    </para>

    <para>
      This module supports the printer's ICC profile which is somewhat mandatory if you want to
      get a high quality print close to the image displayed on the screen.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is important to note that ICC profiles provided by the paper and/or printer
      manufacturers cannot be used on GNU/Linux as they depend on the printer drivers. The
      darktable print module is using <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS</ulink> and there
      is no ready-to-use ICC profiles for this driver.

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">profile</bridgehead>

      <para>
        The printer's ICC profile for the loaded paper. This is the profile specific to the
        printer and printer's paper. This profile is the last color space transformation done to
        the picture whose goal is to create a high quality print.
      </para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">intent</bridgehead>

      <para>
        The print rendering intent (<quote>perceptual</quote>, <quote>relative
        colorimetric</quote>, <quote>saturation</quote> or <quote>absolute
        colorimetric</quote>). See <xref linkend="rendering_intent"/> for more information.
      </para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">black point compensation</bridgehead>

      <para>
        Whether to adjust the black point of the output profile which is often lighter than the
        input profile. This should be <quote>on</quote> when the above intent is set to
        <quote>relative colorimetric</quote>.

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">margins</bridgehead>

      <para>
        It is possible to set each margin separately or all together by clicking on the middle

      </para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">scale factor</bridgehead>

      <para>
        This information field displays the scaling of the image to fit on the paper. If this
        value is less than 1 the image is down-scaled otherwise it is up-scaled. This is an
        important factor to watch&nbsp;&ndash; a too large value (up-scale) may result in a low
        quality print. The corresponding dpi (dots per inch) is also displayed.
      </para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">alignment</bridgehead>

      <para>
