	<para>darktable can use GPU acceleration via OpenCL to improve performance.</para>

	<sect2><title>The Background</title>
		<para>Processing high resolution images belongs to the more demanding tasks in modern computing. Both, in terms of memory requirements and in terms of 
                      CPU power, getting the best out of a typical 15, 20 or 25 Megapixel image can quickly bring your computer to its limits.</para>

		<para>darktable’s requirements are no exception. Our decision to not compromise processing quality, has led to all calculations being done on 
                      4 × 32bit floating point numbers. This is slower than “ordinary” 8 or 16bit integer algebra, but eliminates all problems of tonal breaks or loss of information.</para>

		<para>A lot of hand optimization has been invested to make darktable as fast as possible. If you run a current version of darktable on a modern 
                      computer, you might not even notice any “slowness”. However, there are conditions and certain modules where you feel (or hear from the howling of 
                      your CPU fan) how much your poor multi-core processor has to struggle.</para>

		<para>That’s where OpenCL comes in. OpenCL allows us to take advantage of the enormous power of modern graphics cards. It has been gamer’s demand 
                      for more and more highly detailed 3D worlds in modern ego shooters, that has fostered GPU development. ATI, NVIDIA and Co had to put enormous FP 
                      processing power into their GPUs to meet these demands. The result is modern graphics cards with highly parallelized GPUs to quickly 
                      calculate surfaces and textures at high frame rates.</para>

		<para>You are not a gamer and you don’t take advantage of that power? Well, then you should at least use it in darktable! For the task of highly parallel
                      floating point calculations modern GPUs are much faster than CPUs. That is especially true, when you want to do the same few processing steps over millions 
                      of items. Typical use case: processing of megapixel images.</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>How OpenCL works</title>
		<para>As you can imagine, hardware architectures of GPUs can vary significantly. There are different producers, and even different generations of GPUs 
                      from the same producer may differ clearly. At the same time GPU manufacturers are normally not willing to disclose many hardware details of their 
                      products to the public. One of the known consequences is the need to use proprietary drivers under Linux, if you want to take full advantage of your 
                      graphics card.</para>

		<para>Fortunately an industry consortium lead by The Khronos Group has developed an open, standardized interface called OpenCL. It eases the use of your 
                      GPU as a numerical processing device. OpenCL offers a C99-like programming language with a strong focus on parallel computing. An application that 
                      wants to use OpenCL will need to bring along a suited OpenCL source code that it then hands over to a hardware specific OpenCL compiler at run-time. 
                      This way the application can use OpenCL on different GPU architectures (even at the same time). All “hardware secrets” are hidden in this compiler 
                      and are normally not visible to the user (or the application). The compiled OpenCL code is loaded onto your GPU and - with certain API calls - it is 
                      ready to do calculations for you.</para>

	<sect2><title>How to activate OpenCL in darktable</title>
		<para>Using OpenCL in darktable requires that your PC is equipped with a suitable graphics card and that it has the required libraries in place. Namely 
                      modern graphics cards from NVIDIA and ATI come with full OpenCL support. The OpenCL compiler is normally shipped as part of the proprietary graphics 
                      driver; it is reachable as a dynamic library called “libOpenCL.so”. This library must be in a folder where it is found by your system’s dynamic linker.</para>

		<para>When darktable starts, it will first try to find and load libOpenCL.so and – on success – check if the available graphics card comes with OpenCL support. 
                      A sufficient amount of graphics memory (1GB+) needs to be available to take advantage of the GPU. If that is OK, darktable tries to setup its OpenCL 
                      environment: a processing context needs to be initialized, a calculation pipeline to be started, OpenCL source code files (extension is .cl) need to be 
                      read and compiled and the included routines (called OpenCL kernels) need to be prepared for darktablele’s modules. If all that is done, the preparation 
                      is finished.</para>

		<para>Per default OpenCL support is activated in darktable if all the above steps were successful. If you want to de-activate it you can do so in "core options" 
                      by unchecking "activate opencl support". This configuration parameter also tells you if OpenCL initialization failed: it is grayed out in that case.</para>

		<para>You can at any time switch OpenCL support off and on; this will take immediate action. Depending on the type of modules you are using, you will notice 
                      the effect as a general speed-up during interactive work and during export. Most modules in darktable can take advantage of OpenCL but not all modules 
                      are demanding enough to make a noticeable difference. In order to feel a real difference, take modules like "shadows and highlights", "sharpen", "lowpass", 
                      "highpass" or as an extreme case "equalizer".</para>

		<para>If you are interested in profiling figures, you can call darktable with command line parameters -d opencl -d perf. After each run of the pixelpipe you 
                      will get a detailed allocation of processing time to each module plus an even more fine grained profile for all used OpenCL kernels.</para>

		<para>Besides the speed-up you should not see any difference in the results between CPU and GPU processing. Except of rounding errors, the results are designed 
                      to be identical. If, for some reasons, darktable fails to properly finish a GPU calculation, it will normally notice and automatically (and transparently) 
                      fall back to CPU processing.</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Possible Problems and Solutions</title>
		<para>darktable will detect OpenCL run-time problems automatically. It will then reprocess everything on CPU; only speed is affected, the final result should 
                      not be endangered.</para>

		<para>There can be various reasons why OpenCL could fail during initialization phase. We depend on hardware requirements and on the presence of certain drivers 
                      and libraries. In addition all these have to fit in terms of maker model and revision number. If anything does not fit, e.g. your graphics driver 
                      (loaded as a kernel module) does not match the version of your libOpenCL.so, OpenCL support is likely not available.</para>

		<para>In that case, the best thing to do is start darktable from a console with
		    <programlisting>
darktable –d opencl
		    </programlisting>
		      This will give additional debugging output about the initialization and use of OpenCL. First see if you find a line that starts with "[opencl_init] FINALLY …" 
                      This should tell you, if OpenCL support is available for you or not. If initialization failed, look at the messages above for anything 
                      that reads like "could not be detected" or "could not be created". Check if there is a hint about where it failed.</para>

		<para>Here are a few cases observed in the past:</para>

		<para>darktable might tell you that no OpenCL aware graphics card is detected or that the available memory on your GPU is too low and the device is discarded. 
                      In that case you might need to buy a new card, if you really want OpenCL support.</para>

                <para>darktable might find your libOpenCL.so but then tell you that it couldn't get a platform. NVIDIA drivers will often give error code -1001 in that case.
                      This happens because libOpenCL.so is only a wrapper library. For the real work further libraries - specific to vendor, device and driver - need to be loaded. 
                      This failed for some reason. There is a structure of files in /etc/OpenCL on your system that libOpenCL.so consults to find these libraries. Check if you 
                      find something fishy in there and try to fix it. Often the needed libraries cannot be found by your system's dynamic loader. Giving full path 
                      names might help.</para>

		<para>darktable might also tell you that a context could not be created. This often indicates a version mismatch between (loaded) graphics driver and libOpenCL. 
                      Check if you have left-over kernel modules or graphics libraries of an older install and take appropriate action. In doubt, make a clean reinstall of your 
                      graphics driver. Sometimes, immediately after a driver update, the loaded kernel driver does not match the newly installed libraries: reboot your system in that case.</para>

		<para>darktable might crash in very rare cases directly during startup. This can happen if your OpenCL setup is completely broken or if driver/library contains a 
                      severe bug. If you can’t fix it, you can still use darktable with option --disable-opencl, which will skip the entire OpenCL initialization step.</para>

		<para>darktable might on some systems fail to compile its OpenCL source files at run-time. In that case you will get a number of error messages looking like typical 
                      compiler errors. This could indicate an incompatibility between your OpenCL implementation and our interpretation of the standard. In that case visit us at 
                      darktable-devel@sourceforge.net and report the problem. Chances are good that we can help you. Please also report in case you see significant differences between 
                      CPU and GPU processing of an image!</para>

		<para>There also exist a few on-CPU implementations of OpenCL. These come as drivers provided by INTEL or AMD. We observed that they do not give us any speed gain versus
                      our hand-optimized CPU code. Therefore we simply discard these devices.</para>

        <sect2><title>Setting up OpenCL for AMD/ATI devices</title>
                <para>While NVIDIA devices will most often run out of the box, there is more to do for AMD/ATI graphics cards. This already starts with the fact that AMD/ATI will 
                      only report to darktable half of the total GPU memory. For a 1GB device this amounts to 512MB, a value which darktable in its standard configuration will refuse 
                      as not being sufficient for its tasks. Consequence: the device will not be used.</para>

                <para>On the net you might find as a tip to set environment variable GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=100 in this case. Indeed this will cause the AMD/ATI driver to report the full 
                      installed memory to darktable. However, there is a problem. On many (most?) cards this will cause buffers not to be allocated on your device but on host! In 
                      this case all memory transfers will need to go through the slow PCIe bus. This will cost you a factor of 10 or more in performance and will render OpenCL useless 
                      for you, especially when exporting files.</para>

                <para>Another environment variable which changes driver behavior is GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT. You could set this to 100 in order to allow memory allocations as high as 
                      1GB on your AMD/ATI card. Problem is that this simply tends not to work and cause darktable to crash sooner or later.</para>

                <para>Our recommendation is to leave these settings untouched. Often your card will be recognized with 512MB memory and a maximum allocation size of 
                      128MB. There are three configuration parameter which you set in file $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc to get things running. Here are the details:</para>

		<sect4><title>opencl_memory_requirement</title>
                      <para>Set this parameter to 500 so that darktable will accept your 512MB graphics memory as being sufficient in memory.</para>
                </sect4>

		<sect4><title>opencl_memory_headroom</title>
                      <para>This parameter controls how much graphics memory (out of the reported one) darktable should leave untouched for driver and display use. As for 
                      AMD/ATI devices we anyhow only can get half 
                      of the available RAM it's safe to set this to zero. So all of the 512MB can be used by darktable.</para>
                </sect4>

		<sect4><title>opencl_avoid_atomics</title>
                      <para>Atomic operations in OpenCL are a special way of data synchronization. They are only used in few kernels. Unfortunately some (most?) AMD/ATI devices 
                      are extremely slow in processing atomics. It's better to process the affected modules on CPU rather than accepting an ultra-slow GPU codepath. Set this 
                      parameter to TRUE if you experience slow processing of modules like shadows&amp;highlights, monochrome, local contrast or global tonemap or if you even get 
                      intermittent system freezes.</para>
                </sect4>
        </sect2>


        <sect2><title>OpenCL performance Optimization</title>
                <para>There are some configuration parameters in $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc that help to finetune your system's OpenCL performance. Performance in this 
                 context mostly means the latency of darktable during interactive work, i.e. how long it takes to reprocess your pixelpipe. For a comfortable workflow it is essential to 
                 keep latency low.</para>

                <para>In order to get profiling info you start darktable from a terminal with
		    <programlisting>
darktable -d opencl -d perf
		    </programlisting>
                 After each reprocessing of pixelpipe - caused by module parameter change, zooming, panning, etc. - you will get the total time and the time spent in each of our OpenCL 
                 kernels. The most reliable value is the total time spent in pixelpipe. [Please note that the timings given for each indiviual module are unreliable when running the OpenCL 
                 pixelpipe asynchronously. (see opencl_async_pixelpipe below).]</para>

                <para>To allow for a fast pixelpipe processing with OpenCL it is essential that we keep the GPU busy. Any interrupts or a stalled data flow will strongly add to the total 
                 processing time. This is especially important for the small image buffers we need to handle during interactive work. They can be processed quickly by a fast GPU. However, 
                 even short-term stalls of the pixelpipe will easily become a bottleneck.</para>

                <para>On the other hand darktable's performance during file exports is more or less only governed by the speed of our algorithms and the horse-powers of your GPU. Short-term 
                 stalls will not have a noticable effect on the total time of an export.</para>


                <para>darktable comes with default settings that should deliver a decent GPU performance on most systems. However, if you want to fiddle around a bit by yourself and try to 
                 optimize things further, here follows a description of the relevant configuration parameters.</para>

                <sect4><title>opencl_async_pixelpipe</title>
                      <para>This boolean flag controls how often we block the OpenCL pixelpipe and get a status on success/failure of all the kernels that have been run. For optimum 
                      latency set this to TRUE, so darktable runs the pixelpipe asynchronously and tries to use as few interrupts as possible. If you experience OpenCL errors like failing 
                      kernels, set the parameter to FALSE. darktable will then interrupt after each module so you can more easily isolate the problem.</para>
                </sect4>

                <sect4><title>opencl_number_event_handles</title>
                      <para>Event handles are used so we can monitor success/failure of kernels and profiling info even if the pixelpipe is run asynchronously. The number of event 
                      handles is a limited resource of your OpenCL driver. For sure we can recycle them, but there is a limited number that we can use at the same time. Unfortunately, 
                      there is no way to find out what the resource limits are; so we need to guess. Our default value of 25 is quite conservative. You might want to try if higher values
                      like 100 give better OpenCL performance. If your driver runs out of free handles you would experience failing OpenCL kernels with error code -5 (CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES)
                      or even crashes or system freezes; reduce the number again in that case. A value of 0 will block darktable from using any event handles. This will prevent darktable from 
                      properly monitoring the success of your OpenCL kernels but saves some driver overhead. The consequence is that any failures will likely lead to garbled output without 
                      darktable taking notice; only recommended if you know for sure that your system runs rock-solid. You can also set this parameter to -1, which means that darktable assumes 
                      no restriction in the number of event handles; this is not recommended.</para>
                </sect4>

                <sect4><title>opencl_synch_cache</title>
                      <para>This parameter, if set to TRUE, will force darktable to fetch image buffers from your GPU after each module and store them in its pixelpipe cache. This 
                      is a very resource consuming operation. It only makes sense if you have a rather slow GPU. In that case darktable might in fact save some time when module 
                      parameters have changed, as it can go back to some cached intermediate state and reprocess only part of the pixelpipe. In most cases this parameter should be 
                      set to FALSE (default).</para>
                </sect4>

                <sect4><title>opencl_micro_nap</title>
                      <para>In an ideal case you keep your GPU busy at 100% when reprocessing the pixelpipe. That's good. On the other hand your GPU is also needed to do regular 
                      GUI updates. It might happen that there is no sufficient time left for this task. Consequence would by a jerky reaction of your GUI on panning, zooming or 
                      when moving sliders. darktable can add small naps into its pixelpipe processing to have the GPU catch some breath and do GUI related stuff. Parameter 
                      opencl_micro_nap controls the duration of these naps in microseconds. You need to experiment in order to find an optimum value for your system. Values of 
                      0, 100, 500 and 1000 are good starting points to try. Defaults to 1000.</para>
                </sect4>
        </sect2>

        <sect2><title>Multiple OpenCL devices</title>
               <para>While most systems will only have one OpenCL capable GPU installed, darktable is also able to make use of multiple devices in parallel. There is a configuration
                     parameter which helps to optimize GPU priorities in that case.</para>

               <para>It is important to understand how darktable uses OpenCL devices. Each processing sequence of an image to convert an input to the final output using a certain history stack
                     is run in a so called pixelpipe. There are four different types of pixelpipe defined by darktable. One type is responsible to process the center image view (or full view)
                     in darkroom mode, another pixelpipe processes the preview image (navigation window) top left in darkroom mode. Of each of these two pixelpipe there can be one
                     at a time - with the full and the preview pixelpipe running in parallel. In addition there can be multiple parallel pixelpipes doing file exports and there can be 
                     multiple parallel pixelpipes generating thumbnails. If an OpenCL device is available darktable can dynamically allocate it to one specific pixelpipe for one run.</para>

               <para>The computational demands depend a lot on the pixelpipe type. Preview image and thumbnails have a low resolution and can be processed quickly; center image view
                     is much more demanding, let alone the pixelpipe doing a file export. If you have a reasonably fast GPU and want to get a low latency during interactive work, it is
                     therefore important that your GPU is allocated to do the more demanding center image (full) pixelpipe, while the small preview image can be processed in parallel even
                     by a slower CPU. Older versions of darktable would therefore not allow preview pixelpipe to grab any OpenCL device.</para>

               <para>Starting with darktable 1.2 there is a more flexible scheme to allocate and prioritize your OpenCL device(s). Configuration parameter opencl_device_priority
                     holds a string with the following structure:
		    <programlisting>
a,b,c.../k,l,m.../o,p,q.../x,y,z...
		    </programlisting></para>
                    
               <para>Each letter represents one specific OpenCL device. There are four fields in the parameter string separated by a slash, each representing one type of pixelpipe.
                     "a,b,c..." defines the devices that are allowed to process the center image (full) pixelpipe. Likewise devices "k,l,m..." can process the preview pixelpipe, 
                     "o,p,q..." the export pixelpipes and finally "x,y,z..." the thumbnail pixelpipes. An empty field means that no OpenCL device may serve
                     this type of pixelpipe.</para>

               <para>darktable has an internal numbering system, where the first detected OpenCL device will receive number "0". All further devices are numbered consecutively.
                     This number together with the device name is displayed when you start darktable with '-d opencl'. You can specify a device
                     either by number or by name (upper/lower case and whitespace do not matter). If you have more than one device - all with the same
                     name - you need to use the device numbers in order to differentiate them.</para>

               <para>A device specifier can be preceeded by an exclamation mark "!", in which case the following device is excluded from processing
                     this pixelpipe. You can also give an asterisk "*" as a wildcard, representing all devices not mentioned explicitely before in that group.</para>

               <para>Sequence order within a group matters. darktable will read the list from left to right and whenever it tries to allocate an OpenCL device to a pixelpipe it will scan
                     the devices in that order, taking the first free device it finds.</para>

               <para>darktable's default setting for opencl_device_priority is:
		    <programlisting>
*/!0,*/*/*
		    </programlisting>
                     Any detected OpenCL device is allowed to process our center view image. The first OpenCL device (0) is not allowed to process the preview pixelpipe.
                     As a consequence, if there is only one GPU owned by your system, preview pixelpipe will always be processed on CPU, keeping your single GPU exclusively for the more 
                     demanding center image view. This is reasonable and identical to the old behavior. No restrictions apply to export and thumbnail pixelpipes.</para>
                    
               <para>The default is a good choice if you have only one device. If you have several devices it forms a reasonable starting point. However, as your devices might 
                     have quite different levels of processing power, it makes sense to invest a few thoughts and optimize your priority list.</para>

               <para>Here is an example. Let's assume we have a system with two devices, a fast Radeon HD7950 and an older and slower
                     GeForce GTS450. darktable (started with '-d opencl') will report the following devices:
		    <programlisting>
[opencl_init] successfully initialized.
[opencl_init] here are the internal numbers and names of 
                          OpenCL devices available to darktable:
[opencl_init]           0       'GeForce GTS 450'
[opencl_init]           1       'Tahiti'
[opencl_init] FINALLY: opencl is AVAILABLE on this system.
		    </programlisting>
                    So the GeForce GTS 450 is detected as the first device; the Radeon HD7950 ('Tahiti') as the second one. This order will normally not change unless the
                    hardware or driver configuration is modified. But it's better to use device names rather than numbers to be on the safe side.</para>

              <para>As the GTS450 is slower than the HD7950, an optimized opencl_device_priority could look like:
		    <programlisting>
!GeForce GTS450,*/!Tahiti,*/Tahiti,*/Tahiti,*
		    </programlisting>
                    The GTS450 is explicitely excluded from doing the center image pixelpipe; this is reserved to "all" other devices (i.e. the HD7950/Tahiti). Completely the opposite for our preview
                    pixelpipe. Here the Tahiti is excluded, so that only the GTS450 will be allowed to do the work.</para>

              <para>For file export and thumbnail generation we want all hands on deck. However, darktable should first look if device Tahiti 
                    is free, because it's faster. If that's not the case, all other devices - in fact only the GTS450 - are checked.</para>

        <sect2><title>OpenCL still does not run for me!</title>
		<para>As has been said before OpenCL systems come with a huge variety of setups: different gpu manufacturers, different gpu models, varying amounts of gpu memory, different drivers,
		different distributions etc. Many of the potential problems will only appear with a very specific combination of those factors.</para>

		<para>As we developers of darktable on our computers only have access to a small fraction of those variations, please understand that we might not be able to fix your specific problem.
		There is not much we can do, if there is no way for us to reproduce.</para>

		<para>If nothing else helps, the best option might be to start darktable with
			<programlisting>
darktable --disable-opencl
			</programlisting>
		In the end there is nothing in darktable which only runs on gpu. Don't let OpenCL discourage you; also darktable's cpu code is highly optimized and performant!</para>
