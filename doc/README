this is darktable, a free raw photo viewer and organizer.

to build it, you need:

 - gtk+-2.0 (and dependencies, e.g. cairo, gdkpixbuf, etc.)
 - png, jpeg, tiff libraries (should be pulled by gdkpixbuf)
 - exiv2, OpenEXR, lensfun, lcms2, curl

optionally, you might need for special features:

 - gconf (for gconf backend)
 - gphoto2 (for camera support, recommended)
 - librsvg2 (for watermark plugin)
 - flickcurl (for Flickr support)
 - libGL/sdl12 (to build slideshow viewer)
 - dbus-glib, gnome-keyring (kwallet/gnome keyring support)

other used packages (supplied in the source tree):

 - LibRaw nikon_curve (taken from ufraw)

then, type:
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
$ make install (or sudo make install)
$ darktable

(the first step is only necessary when building from git for the first time)
and enjoy!
